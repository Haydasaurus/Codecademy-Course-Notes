# Arrays
In Java, an array is used to store a list of elements of the same datatype.

Arrays are fixed in size and their elements are ordered.

```Java
// Create an array of 5 int elements
int[] marks = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
```

## Creating an Array
In Java, an array can be created in the following ways:

1.  Using the {} notation, by adding each element all at once.

```Java
int[] age = {20, 21, 30};
```

2. Using the new keyword, and assigning each position of the array individually.

``` Java
int[] marks = new int[3];

marks[0] = 50;
marks[1] = 70;
marks[2] = 93;
```

---

## Index
An index refers to an elementâ€™s position within an array.

The index of an array starts from 0 and goes up to one less than the total length of the array.

```Java
int[] marks = {50, 55, 60, 70, 80};

System.out.println(marks[0]);
// Output: 50

System.out.println(marks[4]);
// Output: 80
```

---

## ArrayList
In Java, an `ArrayList` is used to represent a dynamic list.

While arrays are fixed in size (the length cannot be modified), an `ArrayList` allows flexibility by allowing for the addition and removal of elements.

```Java
// Import the ArrayList package
import java.util.ArrayList;

// Create an ArrayList called students
ArrayList<String> students = new ArrayList<String>();
```

---

## Modifying ArrayLists in Java
An `ArrayList` can easily be modified using built-in methods.

To add elements to an ArrayList, you use the `.add()` method. The element that you want to add goes inside of the `()`.

To remove elements from an ArrayList, you use the `.remove()` method. Inside the `()` you can specify the index of the element that you want to remove. Alternatively, you can directly specify the element that you want to remove.

```Java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Students {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Create an ArrayList called studentList, which initially holds []
    ArrayList<String> studentList = new ArrayList<String>();

    // Add students to the ArrayList
    studentList.add("John");
    studentList.add("Lily");
    studentList.add("Samantha");
    studentList.add("Tony");

    // Remove John from the ArrayList, then Lily
    studentList.remove(0);
    studentList.remove("Lily");

    // studentList now holds [Samantha, Tony]

    System.out.println(studentList);
  }
}
```
