Prime Number Finder

# Prime Number Finder
Create a `primeFinder()` method that takes in a number, `n`, and returns all the prime numbers from `1` to `n` (inclusive). As a reminder, a prime number is a number that is only divisible by `1` and itself.

For example, `primeFinder(13)` should return `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]`.
