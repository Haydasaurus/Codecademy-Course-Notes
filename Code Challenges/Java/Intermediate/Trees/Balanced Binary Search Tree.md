Balanced Binary Search Tree

# Balanced Binary Search Tree
Given a sorted array of numbers `a`, write a function `balancedBst(a)` to create a balanced binary search tree. A balanced [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) has no more than one level of depth difference between the right and left sides of the tree.

Each value in the array `a` should correspond to a node value. The return value of `balancedBst()` will be the root node of the balanced tree. An empty array passed to `balancedBst()` should return `null`.

For example, given an array `a = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}`, you want to create a balanced tree that may resemble the following:

```pseudo
       5
     /   \
    3     7
   / \   / \
  2   4 6   8
 /
1
```

The above figure represents a balanced tree because there is at most 1 level of difference between the depths of each side of the tree.

For this challenge you are given the class `TreeNode` with the members:

-   `value`: the node value
-   `left`: the left child node; defaults to `null`
-   `right`: the right child node; defaults to `null`

The `print()` function is also implemented in the class `TreeNode`, so at any time you can print the root node to see a basic representation of the tree.

This challenge and variations of it were reported to have been asked at interviews with Google. If youâ€™ve covered the material in [Pass the Technical Interview with Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-java) or an equivalent, you should be able to solve this challenge. If you have trouble, try refreshing your knowledge there first.

    Integer[] a = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8};
    TreeNode balancedTree = balancedBst(a);
