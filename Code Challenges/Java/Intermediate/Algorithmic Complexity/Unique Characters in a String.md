Unique Characters in a String

# Unique Characters in a String
Write a `uniqueCharacters()` function that determines if any given string has all unique characters (i.e. no character in the string is duplicated). If the string has all unique characters, the function should return `true`. If the string does not have all unique characters, return `false`.

For example, `uniqueCharacters("apple")` should return `false`.

This challenge and variations of it were reported to have been asked at interviews with Google. If youâ€™ve covered the material in [Pass the Technical Interview with Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-java) or an equivalent, you should be able to solve this challenge. If you have trouble, try refreshing your knowledge there first.

Note that if the function is called with an empty string (`""`), the program should return an error message.

import java.util.*;

public class UniqueCharacters {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(uniqueCharacters("apple"));
  }

  public static boolean uniqueCharacters(String strIn) {
    
  }

}
