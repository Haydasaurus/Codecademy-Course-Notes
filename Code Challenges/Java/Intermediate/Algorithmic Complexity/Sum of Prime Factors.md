Sum of Prime Factors

# Sum of Prime Factors
Create a `sumOfPrimeFactors()` method that takes in an integer `n` and returns the sum of all of its prime factors. As a reminder, a prime number is a number whose only factors are one and itself. Therefore, a prime factor is a factor of a given number that itself is a prime number.

For example, `sumOfPrimeFactors(91)` should return `20` since its prime factors are 13 and 7.

This challenge and variations of it were reported to have been asked at interviews with Google. If youâ€™ve covered the material in [Pass the Technical Interview with Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-java) or an equivalent, you should be able to solve this challenge. If you have trouble, try refreshing your knowledge there first.
