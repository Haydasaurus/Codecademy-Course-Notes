Fibonacci Finder

# Fibonacci Finder
Create a `fibFinder()` method that finds the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. As a reminder, the Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence that begins with 0 and 1, with each following term being the sum of the two previous terms.

For example, the first two terms of the sequence are represented by `fibFinder(0)` and `fibFinder(1)`, which return `0` and `1`, respectively. `fibFinder(6)` should return `8`.

This challenge was reported to have been asked in interviews at many top companies, including Google.
