Max Product Finder

# Max Product Finder
Create a `maxProductFinderK()` method that takes in a list of numbers and an integer `k`, and returns the largest product that can be attained from any `k` integers in the list. You may presume that the length of the list of integers is greater than or equal to `k`.

For example, calling `maxProductFinderK()` on `([-8, 6, -7, 3, 2, 1, -9], 2)` should return `72`, and calling `maxProductFinderK()` on `([-8, 6, -7, 3, 2, 1, -9], 3)` should return `432`.
