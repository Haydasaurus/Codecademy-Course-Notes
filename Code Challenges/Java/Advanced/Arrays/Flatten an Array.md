Flatten an Array

# Flatten an Array
Write a `flattenArray()` method that takes in a 2-dimensional array, flattens it into a 1-dimensional array, and returns it. You can assume that you will only be given one or two-dimensional arrays

For example, calling `flattenArray()` on `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5])` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

This challenge was reported to have been asked at interviews with Facebook, as well as right here at Codecademy! If youâ€™ve covered the material in [Pass the Technical Interview with Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-java) or an equivalent, you should be able to solve this challenge. If you have trouble, try refreshing your knowledge there first.

```Java
import java.lang .*;
public class FlattenArray {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[][] arr = new int[][]{{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}};
    int[] answer = flattenArray(arr);
    for(int i = 0; i < answer.length; i++) {
      System.out.println(answer[i]);
    }
  }

  public static int[] flattenArray(int[][] input) {
    // Write your code here
    
  }
}
