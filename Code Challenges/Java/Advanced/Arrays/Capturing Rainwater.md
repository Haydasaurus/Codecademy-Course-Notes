Capturing Rainwater

# Capturing Rainwater
Create a `capturingRainwater()` method that takes in an array of heights, and returns the amount of rainwater that could be contained in that array.

For example, the array `[4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2]` can be represented in the following histogram:

As you can see, there are 6 units of water that can be contained, so calling `capturing_rainwater()` on the array `[4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2]` should return `6`.
