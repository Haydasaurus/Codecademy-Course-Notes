Semi-Prime Numbers

# Semi-Prime Numbers
Create a `semiPrimeCount()` method that takes in an integer, `n`, and returns the count of semi-prime numbers from 1 to `n`, non-inclusive. A semi-prime number is a number that is the product of two prime numbers. Note that the numbers don’t have to be distinct, meaning that 4 is a semi-prime number since it is 2 * 2.

For example, `semiPrimeCount()` called on `10` should return `3` since there are 3 semi-prime numbers from 1-10 (4, 6, 9). Remember, it’s non-inclusive!

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    semiPrimeCount(10);
  }

  public static int semiPrimeCount(int n) {
    
  }
}
