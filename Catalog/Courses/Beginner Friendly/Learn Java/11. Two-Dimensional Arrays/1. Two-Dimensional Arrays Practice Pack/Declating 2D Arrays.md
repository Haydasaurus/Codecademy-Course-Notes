# Declaring 2D Arrays

```java
int[][] twoDIntArray;
String[][] twoDStringArray;
double[][] twoDDoubleArray;
```

In Java, 2D arrays are stored as arrays of arrays. Therefore, the way 2D arrays are declared is similar 1D array objects. 2D arrays are declared by defining a data type followed by two sets of square brackets.
