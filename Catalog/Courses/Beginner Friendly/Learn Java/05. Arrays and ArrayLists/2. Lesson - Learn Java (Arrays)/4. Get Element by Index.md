Learn Java: Arrays
# Get Element By Index

Now that we have an array declared and initialized, we want to be able to get values out of it.

We use square brackets, `[` and `]`, to access data at a certain index:

```java
double[] prices = {13.1, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66}; 

System.out.println(prices[1]);
```

This command would print:

```
15.87
```

This happens because `15.87` is the item at the `1` index of the array. Remember, the index of an array starts at `0` and ends at an index of one less than the number of elements in the array.

If we try to access an element outside of its appropriate index range, we will receive an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` error.

For example, if we were to run the command `System.out.println(prices[5])`, we’d get the following output:

```java
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 5
```

Exercise:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Newsfeed {
  
  String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
  int[] views = {0, 0, 0, 0};
  
  public Newsfeed(){

  }
    
  public String[] getTopics(){
    return topics;
  }
  
  public String getTopTopic(){
    
  }
  
  public void viewTopic(int topicIndex){
    
  }

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    
    System.out.println("The top topic is "+ sampleFeed.getTopTopic());
    
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(1);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(1);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(3);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(2);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(2);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(1);
    
    System.out.println("The " + sampleFeed.topics[1] + " topic has been viewed " + sampleFeed.views[1] + " times!"); 
  }
}
```

**1.** We have augmented the `Newsfeed` class to start with the `topics` array as an instance field.

Fill in the `getTopTopic()` method to return the 0th index of the `topics` array.

Hint: You can return the 0th index of an array `catNames` using this syntax:
```java
return catNames[0];
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Newsfeed {
  
  String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
  int[] views = {0, 0, 0, 0};
  
  public Newsfeed(){

  }
    
  public String[] getTopics(){
    return topics;
  }
  
  public String getTopTopic(){
    return topics[0];
  }
  
  public void viewTopic(int topicIndex){
    
  }

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    
    System.out.println("The top topic is "+ sampleFeed.getTopTopic());
    
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(1);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(1);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(3);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(2);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(2);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(1);
    
    System.out.println("The " + sampleFeed.topics[1] + " topic has been viewed " + sampleFeed.views[1] + " times!"); 
  }
}
```

**2.** But wait — we added more to the `Newsfeed` class. Now, each instance starts with an array of zeros called `views` as an instance field.

Every time someone views a topic, we want to increment the value of the appropriate field in `views`.

For example, if someone views an `"Opinion"` piece, we want to increase the value of the 0th index of `views` from `0` to `1`. If they view it again, we want to increase the value to `2`.

We have written a method signature for `viewTopic()`, which takes in an `int` called `topicIndex`.

Inside the method, set the value of the `views` array at the index `topicIndex` to the current value plus `1`.

Hint: If we had a variable called `numCats` that we wanted to increment by `1`, we could use the syntax:
```java
numCats = numCats + 1;
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Newsfeed {
  
  String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
  int[] views = {0, 0, 0, 0};
  
  public Newsfeed(){

  }
    
  public String[] getTopics(){
    return topics;
  }
  
  public String getTopTopic(){
    return topics[0];
  }
  
  public void viewTopic(int topicIndex){
    views[topicIndex] = views[topicIndex] + 1;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    
    System.out.println("The top topic is "+ sampleFeed.getTopTopic());
    
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(1);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(1);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(3);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(2);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(2);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(1);
    
    System.out.println("The " + sampleFeed.topics[1] + " topic has been viewed " + sampleFeed.views[1] + " times!"); 
  }
}
```
