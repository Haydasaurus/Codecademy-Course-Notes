Learn Java: Arrays
# Length

What if we have an array storing all the usernames for our program, and we want to quickly see how many users we have? To get the length of an array, we can access the `length` field of the array object:

```java
String[] menuItems = new String[5];
System.out.println(menuItems.length);
```

This command would print `5`, since the `menuItems` array has `5` slots, even though they are all empty.

If we print out the length of the `prices` array:

```java
double[] prices = {13.1, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66}; 

System.out.println(prices.length);
```

We would see `4`, since there are four items in the `prices` array!

Exercise:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Newsfeed {
  
  String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
  int[] views = {0, 0, 0, 0};
  
  public Newsfeed(){

  }
    
  public String[] getTopics(){
    return topics;
  }
  
  public int getNumTopics(){
    
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    
    System.out.println("The number of topics is "+ sampleFeed.getNumTopics());
   
  }
}
```

**1.** In the method `getNumTopics()`, return the length of the `topics` array.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Newsfeed {
  
  String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
  int[] views = {0, 0, 0, 0};
  
  public Newsfeed(){

  }
    
  public String[] getTopics(){
    return topics;
  }
  
  public int getNumTopics(){
    return topics.length;
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    
    System.out.println("The number of topics is "+ sampleFeed.getNumTopics());
   
  }
}
```
