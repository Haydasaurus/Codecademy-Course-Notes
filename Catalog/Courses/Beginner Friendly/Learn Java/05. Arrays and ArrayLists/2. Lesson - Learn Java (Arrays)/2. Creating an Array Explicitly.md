Learn Java: Arrays
# Creating an Array Explicitly

Imagine that we’re using a program to keep track of the prices of different clothing items we want to buy. We would want a list of the prices and a list of the items they correspond to. To create an array, we provide a name and declare the type of data it holds:

```java
double[] prices;
```

Just like with variables, we can declare and initialize in the same line. This allows us to explicitly initialize the array to contain the data we want to store :

```java
double[] prices = {13.15, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};
```

We can use arrays to hold `String`s and other objects as well as primitives:

```java
String[] clothingItems = {"Tank Top", "Beanie", "Funny Socks", "Corduroys"};
```

Exercise:

```java
public class Newsfeed {
  
  
  public Newsfeed(){
    
  }
  
  // Create getTopics() below:
  

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    /*
    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(topics);
    */
  }
}
```

**1.** We have an empty `Newsfeed` class that does not store anything yet.

First, make a method called `getTopics()`, which:

-   is `public`
-   returns a `String` array
-   does not take any parameters

For now, leave the method empty.

Hint: A method called `getPrices()` that takes in no parameters and returns an int array would look like:
```java
public int[] getPrices(){

}
```

Since this method doesn’t return an `int[]` like it says it will, the file won’t compile yet! We’ll fix that when we add a `return` statement.

```java
public class Newsfeed {
  
  
  public Newsfeed() {
    
  }
  
  // Create getTopics() below:
  public String[] getTopics() {

  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    /*
    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(topics);
    */
  }
}
```

**2.** Inside the `getTopics()` method, create a `String` array called `topics` and set it equal to an array containing these elements, in order:

```
Opinion
Tech
Science
Health
```

Then, return `topics` from the method!

Hint: If we were making an integer array called `numVisitors` with these numbers in order:
```
1
1
2
3
5
```

We could use the command:
```java
int[] numVisitors = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5};
```

```java
public class Newsfeed {
  
  
  public Newsfeed() {
    
  }
  
  // Create getTopics() below:
  public String[] getTopics() {
    String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
    return topics;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    /*
    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(topics);
    */
  }
}
```

**3.** Uncomment the lines in the main method to see how the `getTopics()` method works on a `Newsfeed` instance.

```java
public class Newsfeed {
  
  
  public Newsfeed() {
    
  }
  
  // Create getTopics() below:
  public String[] getTopics() {
    String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
    return topics;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();

    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(topics);
  }
}
```
