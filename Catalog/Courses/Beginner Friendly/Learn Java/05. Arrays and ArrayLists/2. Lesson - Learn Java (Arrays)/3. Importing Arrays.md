Learn Java: Arrays
# Importing Arrays

When we printed out the array we created in the last exercise, we saw a memory address that did not help us understand what was contained in the array.

If we want to have a more descriptive printout of the array itself, we need a `toString()` method that is provided by the `Arrays` _package_ in Java.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
```

We put this at the top of the file, before we even define the class!

When we import a package in Java, we are making all of the methods of that package available in our code.

The `Arrays` package has many useful methods, including `Arrays.toString()`. When we pass an array into `Arrays.toString()`, we can see the contents of the array printed out:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
 
public class Lottery(){
 
  public static void main(String[] args){
    int[] lotteryNumbers = {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42};
    String betterPrintout = Arrays.toString(lotteryNumbers);
    System.out.println(betterPrintout);
  }
 
}
```

This code will print:

```
[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
```

Exercise:

```java
// import the Arrays package here:

public class Newsfeed {
  
  
  public Newsfeed(){
    
  }
    
  public String[] getTopics(){
    String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
    return topics;
  }
  

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(topics);
  }
}
```

**1.** In order to make our printout of the `topics` array more helpful, we are going to want to use the `toString()` method from the `Arrays` package.

To use it, we first must import the `Arrays` package from `java.util`. Import the package at the top of the **Newsfeed.java** file.

```java
// import the Arrays package here:
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Newsfeed {
  
  
  public Newsfeed(){
    
  }
    
  public String[] getTopics(){
    String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
    return topics;
  }
  

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(topics);
  }
}
```

**2.** Now that you have the `Arrays` package, use its `toString()` method to print out the `topics` array in the `main()` method.

```java
// import the Arrays package here:
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Newsfeed {
  
  
  public Newsfeed(){
    
  }
    
  public String[] getTopics(){
    String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
    return topics;
  }
  

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(topics));
  }
}
```
