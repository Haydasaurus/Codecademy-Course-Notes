Learn Java: Arrays
# Review

We have now seen how to store a list of values in arrays. We can use this knowledge to make organized programs with more complex variables.

Throughout the lesson, we have learned about:

-   Creating arrays explicitly, using `{` and `}`.
-   Accessing an index of an array using `[` and `]`.
-   Creating empty arrays of a certain size, and filling the indices one by one.
-   Getting the length of an array using `length`.
-   Using the argument array `args` that is passed into the `main()` method of a class.

Exercise:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Classroom {
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    
  }
}
```

**1.** In order to practice the skills you’ve learned throughout the lesson, we’re going to make and use some arrays in the `main()` method of a new `Classroom` class.

First, inside `main()`, make a `String` array called `students`, and set it equal to the following students, in order:

```
Sade
Alexus
Sam
Koma
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Classroom {
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    String[] students = {"Sade", "Alexus", "Sam", "Koma"};
    
  }
}
```

**2.** Now, we’re going to store the averages on the most recent math test. Create an array called `mathScores` and set it to an empty array of size 4. It should hold `double`s.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Classroom {
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    String[] students = {"Sade", "Alexus", "Sam", "Koma"};
    double[] mathScores = new double[4];
  }
}
```

**3.** Sade got a 94.5 on the test. Store this value in the 0th index of the `mathScores` array.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Classroom {
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    String[] students = {"Sade", "Alexus", "Sam", "Koma"};
    double[] mathScores = new double[4];
    mathScores[0] = 94.5;
  }
}
```

**4.** Sam got a 76.8 on the test. Store this value in the appropriate spot in the `mathScores` array.

Hint: `"Sam"` occupies index 2 of the students array, so the score should occupy the same index of `mathScores`.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Classroom {
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    String[] students = {"Sade", "Alexus", "Sam", "Koma"};
    double[] mathScores = new double[4];
    mathScores[0] = 94.5;
    mathScores[2] = 76.8;
  }
}
```

**5.** Write a print statement to say:
```
The number of students in the class is <numStudents>.
```

with `<numStudents>` replaced by the length of the `students` array.

For example, if the array has 7 elements, the printout should read:
```
The number of students in the class is 7.
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Classroom {
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    String[] students = {"Sade", "Alexus", "Sam", "Koma"};
    double[] mathScores = new double[4];
    mathScores[0] = 94.5;
    mathScores[2] = 76.8;

    System.out.println("The number of students in the class is " + students.length + ".");
  }
}
```
