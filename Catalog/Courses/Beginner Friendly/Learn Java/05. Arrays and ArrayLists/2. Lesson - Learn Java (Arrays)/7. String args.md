Learn Java: Arrays
# String[] args

When we write `main()` methods for our programs, we use the parameter `String[] args`. Now that we know about array syntax, we can start to parse what this means.

A `String[]` is an array made up of `String`s. Examples of `String` arrays:

```java
String[] humans = {"Talesha", "Gareth", "Cassie", "Alex"};
String[] robots = {"R2D2", "Marvin", "Bender", "Ava"};
```

The `args` parameter is another example of a `String` array. In this case, the array `args` contains the arguments that we pass in from the terminal when we run the class file. (So far, `args` has been empty.)

So how can you pass arguments to `main()`? Let’s say we have this class `HelloYou`:

```java
public class HelloYou {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello " + args[0]);  
  }
}
```

When we run the file `HelloYou` in the terminal with an argument of `"Laura"`:

```
java HelloYou Laura
```

We get the output:

```
Hello Laura
```

The `String[] args` would be interpreted as an array with one element, `"Laura"`.

When we use `args[0]` in the main method, we can access that element like we did in `HelloYou`.

Exercise:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Newsfeed {
  
  String[] topics;
  
  public Newsfeed(String[] initialTopics) {
		topics = initialTopics;
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
		Newsfeed feed;
    if (args[0].equals("Human")) {
      
      //topics for a Human feed:
      String[] humanTopics = {"Politics", "Science", "Sports", "Love"};
			feed = new Newsfeed(humanTopics);
      
    } else if(_____________) {
      
      //topics for a Robot feed:
      String[] robotTopics = {"Oil", "Parts", "Algorithms", "Love"};
      feed = new Newsfeed(robotTopics);
      
    } else {
      String[] genericTopics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
      feed = new Newsfeed(genericTopics);
    }
        
    System.out.println("The topics in this feed are:");
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(feed.topics));
  }
}
```

**1.** We want to give the user an option to make a `Newsfeed` object for robots or for humans. We will take either `"Robot"` or `"Human"` as an argument to the `main()` method when the **Newsfeed.java** file is run.

-   If the `args` array holds `"Human"`, we will initialize the feed with human topics.
-   If the `args` array holds `"Robot"`, we will initialize the feed with robot topics.

Replace the blank in the conditional statement to reflect this expected control flow.

Hint: You can check for equality in either of these ways here:
```java
this.equals(that);
```

or
```java
this == that;
```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Newsfeed {
  
  String[] topics;
  
  public Newsfeed(String[] initialTopics) {
		topics = initialTopics;
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
		Newsfeed feed;
    if (args[0].equals("Human")) {
      
      //topics for a Human feed:
      String[] humanTopics = {"Politics", "Science", "Sports", "Love"};
			feed = new Newsfeed(humanTopics);
      
    } else if(args[0].equals("Robot")) {
      
      //topics for a Robot feed:
      String[] robotTopics = {"Oil", "Parts", "Algorithms", "Love"};
      feed = new Newsfeed(robotTopics);
      
    } else {
      String[] genericTopics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
      feed = new Newsfeed(genericTopics);
    }
        
    System.out.println("The topics in this feed are:");
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(feed.topics));
  }
}
```

**2.** In the terminal, run the **Newsfeed.java** file with the argument `"Robot"`.

Now, run the **Newsfeed.java** file with the argument `"Human"`.

Hint: Normally on Codecademy hitting the “Run” button will run your code for you with no arguments. But to run your code with arguments, you’re going to need to run the code yourself from the command line.

Remember that to run programs from the command line, we use syntax like:
```
java programName argument1 argument2 argument3
```

So in this case, we’ll use
```
java Newsfeed Robot
```

After running that command, run the command again with `Human` as the argument.
