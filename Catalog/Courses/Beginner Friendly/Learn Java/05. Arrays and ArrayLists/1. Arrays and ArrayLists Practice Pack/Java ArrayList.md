# Java ArrayList

```java
// import the ArrayList package
import java.util.ArrayList;
 
// create an ArrayList called students
ArrayList<String> students = new ArrayList<String>();
```

In Java, an `ArrayList` is used to represent a dynamic list.

While Java arrays are fixed in size (the size cannot be modified), an `ArrayList` allows flexibility by being able to both add and remove elements.
