# Array creation in Java

```java
int[] age = {20, 21, 30};
 
int[] marks = new int[3];
marks[0] = 50; 
marks[1] = 70;
marks[2] = 93;
```

In Java, an array can be created in the following ways:

-   Using the `{}` notation, by adding each element all at once.
-   Using the `new` keyword, and assigning each position of the array individually.
