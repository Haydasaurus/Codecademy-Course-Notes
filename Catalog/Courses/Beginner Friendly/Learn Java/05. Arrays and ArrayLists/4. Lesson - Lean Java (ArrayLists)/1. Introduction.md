Learn Java: ArrayLists
# Introduction

When we work with arrays in Java, we’ve been limited by the fact that once an array is created, it has a fixed size. We can’t add or remove elements.

But what if we needed to add to the book lists, newsfeeds, and other structures we were using arrays to represent?

To create mutable and dynamic lists, we can use Java’s `ArrayList`s. `ArrayList`s allow us to:

-   Store object references as elements
-   Store elements of the same type (just like arrays)
-   Access elements by index (just like arrays)
-   Add elements
-   Remove elements

Remember how we had to import `java.util.Arrays` in order to use additional array methods? To use an `ArrayList` at all, we need to import them from Java’s `util` package as well:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

Let’s learn how to make use of this powerful object…

Exercise:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Shopping {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    String[] groceryItems = {"steak", "milk", "jelly beans"};
    double[] prices = {25.00, 2.95, 2.50};
    
    // Adding ham to the groceries
    groceryItems[3] = "ham";
    prices[3] = 4.99;
    
  }
  
}
```

**1.** In **Shopping.java** we’ve defined two arrays:

-   `groceryItems`, a `String` array
-   `prices`, a `double` array

We’ve tried to add a new item to the end of each. Run the code — does it work?

Hint: You should see an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` thrown because the length of each array was already set and there’s no room left!

This is a situation where an `ArrayList` would help.
