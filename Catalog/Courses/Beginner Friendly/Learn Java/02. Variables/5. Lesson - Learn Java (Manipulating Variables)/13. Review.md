Learn Java: Manipulating Variables
# Review

What’s the use of having variables if you can’t do anything with them? We’ve now seen some ways you can operate on variables and compare them. The possibilities are endless!

We covered:

-   Addition and subtraction, using `+` and `-`
-   Multiplication and division, using `*` and `/`
-   The modulo operator for finding remainders, `%`
-   Compound assignment operators `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`.
-   The order of operations: parentheses -> exponents -> multiplication, division, modulo -> addition, subtraction
-   Greater than, `>`, and less than, `<`
-   Equal to, `==`, and not equal to, `!=`
-   Greater than or equal to, `>=`, and less than or equal to, `<=`
-   `equals()` for comparing `String`s and other objects
-   Using `+` to concatenate `String`s
-   The `final` keyword which makes variables unchangeable

Practice some of these concepts here, to make sure you have a solid foundation for learning more complicated and exciting Java concepts!

Exercise:

```java
public class BankAccount {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      double balance = 1000.75;
      double amountToWithdraw = 250;
    }       
}
```

**1.** To review, let’s try building some of the bank account functionality we talked about throughout the lesson.

First, create a new `double` variable called `updatedBalance`, and store `balance` with `amountToWithdraw` subtracted from it.

```java
public class BankAccount {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      double balance = 1000.75;
      double amountToWithdraw = 250;
      double updatedBalance = balance - amountToWithdraw;
    }       
}
```

**2.** Now, you’ve decided to split your balance evenly 3 ways and give it to your three best friends.

Create a `double` variable called `amountForEachFriend` that holds your updated balance divided by `3`.

```java
public class BankAccount {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      double balance = 1000.75;
      double amountToWithdraw = 250;
      double updatedBalance = balance - amountToWithdraw;
      double amountForEachFriend = updatedBalance / 3;
    }       
}
```

**3.** Your friends each want to buy a concert ticket with the money you’ve given them. The tickets cost `250`!

Create a `boolean` called `canPurchaseTicket` and set it equal to whether or not `amountForEachFriend` is at least enough to purchase a concert ticket.

Then, use `System.out.println()` to print `canPurchaseTicket`.

Hint: You can use `>=` to create this boolean:
```
boolean somethingIsAtLeast50 = something >= 50;
```

This will be `true` if `something` is at least `50`, and `false` otherwise.

```java
public class BankAccount {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      double balance = 1000.75;
      double amountToWithdraw = 250;
      double updatedBalance = balance - amountToWithdraw;
      double amountForEachFriend = updatedBalance / 3;
      boolean canPurchaseTicket = amountForEachFriend >= 250;
      System.out.println(canPurchaseTicket);
    }       
}
```

**4.** How much money did you give your friends, anyway?

Use `+` and `System.out.println()` to print out:

```
I gave each friend <amountForEachFriend>...
```

with the value of `amountForEachFriend` where `<amountForEachFriend>` is.

```java
public class BankAccount {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      double balance = 1000.75;
      double amountToWithdraw = 250;
      double updatedBalance = balance - amountToWithdraw;
      double amountForEachFriend = updatedBalance / 3;
      boolean canPurchaseTicket = amountForEachFriend >= 250;
      System.out.println("I gave each friend " + amountForEachFriend + "...");
    }       
}
```
