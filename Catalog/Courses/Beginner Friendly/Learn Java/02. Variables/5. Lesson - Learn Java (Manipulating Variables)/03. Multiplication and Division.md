Learn Java: Manipulating Variables
# Multiplication and Division

Let’s say that our employer is calculating our paycheck and depositing it to our bank account. We worked 40 hours last week, at a rate of $15.50 an hour. Java can calculate this with the multiplication operator `*`:

```java
double paycheckAmount = 40 * 15.50;
//paycheckAmount now holds 620.0
```

If we want to see how many hours our total balance represents, we use the division operator `/`:

```java
double balance = 20010.5;
double hourlyRate = 15.5;
double hoursWorked = balance / hourlyRate;
//hoursWorked now holds 1291.0
```

Division has different results with integers. The `/` operator does _integer division_, which means that any remainder is lost.

```java
int evenlyDivided = 10 / 5;
//evenlyDivided holds 2, because 10 divided by 5 is 2
int unevenlyDivided = 10 / 4;
//unevenlyDivided holds 2, because 10 divided by 4 is 2.5
```

`evenlyDivided` stores what you expect, but `unevenlyDivided` holds `2` because `int`s cannot store decimals! It’s important to note that the `int` doesn’t round the decimal, but floors it. Java removes the `0.5` to fit the result into an `int` type!

It’s important to note that if we try to divide any number by `0`, we will get an `ArithmeticException` error as a result.

Exercise:

```java
public class MultAndDivide {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		double subtotal = 30;
    double tax = 0.0875;
	}
}
```

**1.** In `main()`, there is a variable called `subtotal`, which represents the subtotal of an amount to pay on a bill, and a variable called `tax`, which represents the tax rate that will be applied to that subtotal.

Create a `double` variable, `total`, that holds `subtotal` plus the product of `subtotal` and `tax`.

Print the `total` variable!

```java
public class MultAndDivide {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		double subtotal = 30;
	    double tax = 0.0875;
	    double total = subtotal + (subtotal * tax);
	    System.out.println(total);
	}
}
```

**2.** There were 4 people who bought this meal together and want to split the cost.

Create a `double` variable called `perPerson` that holds `total` divided by 4.

Print the `perPerson` variable!

```java
public class MultAndDivide {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		double subtotal = 30;
	    double tax = 0.0875;
	    double total = subtotal + (subtotal * tax);
	    double perPerson = total / 4;
	    System.out.println(perPerson);
	}
}
```
