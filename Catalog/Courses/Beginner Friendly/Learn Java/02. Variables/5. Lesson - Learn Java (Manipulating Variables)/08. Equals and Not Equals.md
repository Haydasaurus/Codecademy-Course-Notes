Learn Java: Manipulating Variables
# Equals and Not Equals

So how would we validate our paycheck to see if we got paid the right amount?

We can use another relational operator to do this. `==` will tell us if two variables are equal:

```java
double paycheckAmount = 620;
double calculatedPaycheck = 15.50 * 40; 

System.out.print(paycheckAmount == calculatedPaycheck);
// This will print true, since paycheckAmount equals calculatedPaycheck
```

Notice that the equality check is **two** equal signs, instead of one. One equal sign, `=`, is how we assign values to variables! It’s easy to mix these up, so make sure to check your code for the right number of equal signs.

To check if two variables are **not** equal, we can use `!=`:

```java
double balance = 20000.0;
double amountToDeposit = 620;
double updatedBalance = balance + amountToDeposit; 

boolean balanceHasChanged = balance != updatedBalance;
// balanceHasChanged holds true, since balance does not equal updatedBalance
```

Exercise:

```java
public class EqualNotEqual {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int songsA = 9;
	    int songsB = 9;
	    int albumLengthA = 41;
	    int albumLengthB = 53;
	}
}
```

**1.** You have unearthed two unlabeled albums, record A and record B.

To see if these are the same album, you’re going to compare the number of songs on each one, and the total length of the albums.

First, create a variable called `sameNumberOfSongs` that stores whether the two albums have the same number of songs.

Hint: To compare the number of songs on each, you could use:
```java
songsA == songsB
```

To print this expression, put it inside `System.out.println()`.

```java
public class EqualNotEqual {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int songsA = 9;
	    int songsB = 9;
	    int albumLengthA = 41;
	    int albumLengthB = 53;
	    boolean sameNumberOfSongs = songsA == songsB;
	    System.out.println(sameNumberOfSongs);
	}
}
```

**2.** Now, create a variable called `differentLength` that stores the result of checking whether the two album lengths are **not** the same.

```java
public class EqualNotEqual {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int songsA = 9;
	    int songsB = 9;
	    int albumLengthA = 41;
	    int albumLengthB = 53;
	    boolean sameNumberOfSongs = songsA == songsB;
	    boolean differentLength = albumLengthA != albumLengthB;
	    System.out.println(differentLength);
	}
}
```
