Learn Java: Manipulating Variables
# Addition and Subtraction

In our bank account example from the last exercise, we used the `+` operator to add the values `balance` and `depositAmount`:

```java
double balance = 20000.99;
double depositAmount = 1000.0;
balance = balance + deposit
Amount;
// balance now holds 21000.99
```

If we wanted to withdraw from the balance, we would use the `-` operator:

```java
double withdrawAmount = 500;
balance = balance - withdrawAmount;
// balance now holds 19500.99
```

Addition and subtraction work with `int` type values as well! If we had `60` pictures of cats on our phone, and we took `24` more, we could use the following line of code to store `84` in `numPicturesOfCats`.

```java
int numPicturesOfCats = 60 + 24;
```

What if we took one additional picture of our cat? We can reflect this change using an increment operator `++`. When we append `++` to a number-based variable, it increases the value by `1`. We also have the decrement operator, `--`, which decreases the value by `1`.

```java
// Take a picturenumPicturesOfCats++ 
// Value is now 85 
// Delete a picturenumPicturesOfCats-- 
// Value is now 84
```

Exercise: 

```java
public class PlusAndMinus {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int zebrasInZoo = 8;
		int giraffesInZoo = 4;
	}
}
```

**1.** Create an `int` variable called `animalsInZoo` that holds the amount of zebras plus the amount of giraffes at the zoo.

Then, print your `animalsInZoo` variable.

```java
public class PlusAndMinus {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int zebrasInZoo = 8;
	    int giraffesInZoo = 4;
	    int animalsInZoo = zebrasInZoo + giraffesInZoo;
	    System.out.println(animalsInZoo);
	}
}
```

**2.** Two of the zebras have been traded to a neighboring rival zoo. Subtract 2 from the number of zebras and store the result in a variable called `numZebrasAfterTrade`.

Then, print the `numZebrasAfterTrade` variable!

```java
public class PlusAndMinus {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int zebrasInZoo = 8;
		int giraffesInZoo = 4;
	    int animalsInZoo = zebrasInZoo + giraffesInZoo;
	    int numZebrasAfterTrade = zebrasInZoo - 2;
	    System.out.println(numZebrasAfterTrade);
	}
}
```
