Learn Java: Manipulating Variables
# final Keyword

Throughout this lesson, we’ve discussed the different ways we can manipulate a variable; however, what do we do with a variable that should never change its value?

For example, the year we were born will always stay the same. There’s no way we can change that information. A value like this in our code should be unchangeable.

To declare a variable with a value that cannot be manipulated, we need to use the `final` keyword. To use the `final` keyword, prepend `final` to a variable declaration like so:

```java
final int yearBorn = 1968;
```

When we declare a variable using `final`, the value cannot be changed; any attempts at doing so will cause an error to occur:

```
error: cannot assign a value to final variable yearBorn
```

Exercise:

```java
public class Final {
	public static void main(String[] args) { 


	}
}
```

**1.** Create an unchangeable `double` variable called `pi` and set its value to `3.14`.

Print the value of `pi`.

Hint: Add the `final` keyword to the variable declaration to ensure the value cannot be changed.

```java
public class Final {
	public static void main(String[] args) { 
      final double pi = 3.14;
      System.out.println(pi);
	}
}
```

**2.** On a new line, try to change the value of `pi`.

What happens when the program is run?

Hint: When you run the code after manipulating the value of `pi`, the program should return an error similar to the following:
```error
error: cannot assign a value to final variable pi
```

```java
public class Final {
	public static void main(String[] args) { 
      final double pi = 3.14;
      pi += 4;
      System.out.println(pi);
	}
}
```
