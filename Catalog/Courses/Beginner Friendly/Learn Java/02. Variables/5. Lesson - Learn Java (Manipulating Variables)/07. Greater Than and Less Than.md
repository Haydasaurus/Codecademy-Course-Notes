Learn Java: Manipulating Variables
# Greater Than and Less Than

Now, we’re withdrawing money from our bank account program, and we want to see if we’re withdrawing less money than what we have available.

Java has _relational operators_ for numeric datatypes that make `boolean` comparisons. These include less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`), which help us solve our withdrawal problem.

```java
double balance = 20000.01;
double amountToWithdraw = 5000.01;
System.out.print(amountToWithdraw < balance);
//this will print true, since amountToWithdraw is less than balance
```

You can save the result of a comparison as a `boolean`, which you learned about in the last lesson.

```java
double myBalance = 200.05;
double costOfBuyingNewLaptop = 1000.05;
boolean canBuyLaptop = myBalance > costOfBuyingNewLaptop;
//canBuyLaptop is false, since 200.05 is not more than 1000.05
```

Exercise: 

```java
public class GreaterLessThan {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		double creditsEarned = 176.5;
	    double creditsOfSeminar = 8;
	    double creditsToGraduate = 180;
	}
}
```

**1.** Print the expression that checks if the amount of credits you have earned, `creditsEarned`, is greater than the number of credits you need to graduate, `creditsToGraduate`.

```java
public class GreaterLessThan {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		double creditsEarned = 176.5;
	    double creditsOfSeminar = 8;
	    double creditsToGraduate = 180;
	    System.out.println(creditsEarned > creditsToGraduate);
	}
}
```


**2.** Create a variable called `creditsAfterSeminar` that holds the amount of credits earned after taking a seminar, which is worth `creditsOfSeminar` credits. `creditsAfterSeminar` should be the sum of `creditsEarned` and `creditsOfSeminar`.

Print out whether `creditsToGraduate` is less than `creditsAfterSeminar`.

```java
public class GreaterLessThan {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		double creditsEarned = 176.5;
	    double creditsOfSeminar = 8;
	    double creditsToGraduate = 180;
	    double creditsAfterSeminar = creditsEarned + creditsOfSeminar;
	    System.out.println(creditsAfterSeminar > creditsToGraduate);
	}
}
```
