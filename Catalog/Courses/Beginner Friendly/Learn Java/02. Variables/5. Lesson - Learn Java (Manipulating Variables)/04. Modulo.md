Learn Java: Manipulating Variables
# Modulo

If we baked 10 cookies and gave them out in batches of 3, how many would we have leftover after giving out all the full batches we could?

The modulo operator `%`, gives us the **remainder** after two numbers are divided.

```java
int cookiesBaked = 10;
int cookiesLeftover = 10 % 3;
//cookiesLeftover holds 1
```

You have 1 cookie left after giving out all the batches of 3 you could!

Modulo can be a tricky concept, so let’s try another example.

Imagine we need to know whether a number is even or odd. An even number is divisible by 2.

Modulo can help! Dividing an even number by 2 will have a **remainder** of 0. Dividing an odd number by 2 will have a **remainder** of 1.

```java
7 % 2
// 1, odd!
8 % 2
// 0, even!
9 % 2
// 1, odd!
```

Exercise:

```java
public class Modulo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int students = 26;
	}
}
```

**1.** You are trying to split up students into groups of 3. How many students will be left out once the groups are made?

Create a variable called `leftOut` that holds the modulo of `students` and 3. Then, print the variable!

```java
public class Modulo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int students = 26;
	    int leftOut = students % 3;
	    System.out.println(leftOut);
	}
}
```
