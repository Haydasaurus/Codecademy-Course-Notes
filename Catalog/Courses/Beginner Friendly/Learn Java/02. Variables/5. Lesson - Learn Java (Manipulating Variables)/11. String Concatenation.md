Learn Java: Manipulating Variables
# String Concatenation

We have covered a lot of built-in functionality in Java throughout this lesson. We’ve seen `+`, `-`, `<`, `==`, and many other operators. Most of these only work on primitives, but some work on `String`s too!

Let’s say we want to print out a variable, and we want to describe it as we print it out. For our bank account example, imagine we want to tell the user:

```
Your username is: <username>
```

With the value of the variable `username` displayed.

The `+` operator, which we used for adding numbers together, can be used to _concatenate_ `Strings`. In other words, we can use it to join two `Strings` together!

```java
String username = "PrinceNelson";System.out.println("Your username is: " + username);
```

This code will print:

```
Your username is: PrinceNelson
```

We can even use a primitive datatype as the second variable to concatenate, and Java will intelligently make it a `String` first:

```java
int balance = 10000;
String message = "Your balance is: " + balance;
System.out.println(message);
```

This code will print:

```
Your balance is: 10000
```

Exercise:

```java
public class Zoo {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      int animals = 12;
      String species = "zebra";
    }       
}
```

**1.** In our zoo, we have a certain number of animals, stored in `animals`, of a certain species, stored in `species`.

Use `+` to make a new `String` variable called `zooDescription`. It should hold a String that looks like:

```java
Our zoo has <animals> <species>s!
```

For example, if we had `5` animals that were all of the species `Masai Giraffe`, the String would say:

```
Our zoo has 5 Masai Giraffes!
```

Hint: You will need to add the String `"Our zoo has "`, the variable `animals`, an extra space `" "`, the variable `species`, and the string `"s!"`:
```java
"Our zoo has " + animals + " " + species + "s!"
```

Store this result in the variable `zooDescription`.

Exercise:

```java
public class Zoo {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      int animals = 12;
      String species = "zebra";
      String zooDescription = "Our zoo has " + animals + " " + species + "s!";
    }       
}
```

**2.** Print out the variable `zooDescription`!

```java
public class Zoo {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      int animals = 12;
      String species = "zebra";
      String zooDescription = "Our zoo has " + animals + " " + species + "s!";
      System.out.println(zooDescription);
    }       
}
```
