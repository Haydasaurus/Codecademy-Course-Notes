# Order of Operations

If we were to place multiple operators in a single expression, what operation would the compiler evaluate first?

```java
int num = 5 * (10 - 4) + 4 / 2;
```

The order of operations dictates the order in which an expression (like the one above) is evaluated. Operators that share the same precedence are evaluated from Left-to-Right within the expression.

The order is as follows:

1.  Parentheses
2.  Exponents
3.  Modulo/Multiplication/Division
4.  Addition/Subtraction

With this new information in mind, let’s dissect the expression from above so that we can find the value of `num`:

```
5 * (10 - 4) + 4 / 2
```

`10 - 4` would be evaluated first because it is wrapped in parentheses. This value would become `6` making our expression look like this:

```
5 * 6 + 4 / 2 
```

Next, `5 * 6` will be evaluated because of the `*` operator. This value is `30`. Our expression now looks like this:

```
30 + 4 / 2
```

Following the order of operations, `4 / 2` will be evaluated next because the division operator `/` has higher precedence than the addition operator `+`. Our expression now resembles the following:

```
30 + 2
```

`30 + 2` is `32`. This means that the value of `num` is `32`.

Exercise:

```java
public class Operations {
	public static void main(String[] args) { 

    int expression1 = 5 % 2 - (4 * 2 - 1);
    // System.out.println(expression1);

    int expression2 = (3 + (2 * 2 - 5)) + 6 - 5;
    // System.out.println(expression2);

    int expression3 = 5 * 4 % 3 - 2 + 1;
    // System.out.println(expression3);

	}
}
```

Take a look at the expressions in **Operations.java**.

Solve for the value of each of the expressions on your own.
