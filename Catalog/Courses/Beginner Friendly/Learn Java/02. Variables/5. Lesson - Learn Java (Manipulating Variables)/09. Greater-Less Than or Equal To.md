Learn Java: Manipulating Variables
# Greater/Less Than or Equal To

How could we make sure we got paid at least the amount we expected in our paycheck? We could use greater than or equal to, `>=`, or less than or equal to, `<=`!

```java
double paycheckAmount = 620;
double calculatedPaycheck = 15.50 * 40;
System.out.println(paycheckAmount >= calculatedPaycheck);
//this will print true, since paycheckAmount equals calculatedPaycheck
```

Exercise:

```java
public class GreaterThanEqualTo {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      double recommendedWaterIntake = 8;
      double daysInChallenge = 30;
      double yourWaterIntake = 235.5;
    }       
}
```

**1.** You have been trying to complete a 30 day challenge to drink enough water per day.

Create a `double` variable called `totalRecommendedAmount` and set it to the product of the recommended water intake (`recommendedWaterIntake`) and the amount of days in the challenge (`daysInChallenge`).

```java
public class GreaterThanEqualTo {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      double recommendedWaterIntake = 8;
      double daysInChallenge = 30;
      double yourWaterIntake = 235.5;
      double totalRecommendedAmount = recommendedWaterIntake * daysInChallenge;
    }       
}
```

**2.** Create a `boolean` variable called `isChallengeComplete` and set it to the result of checking if your intake, `yourWaterIntake`, is at least as much as the `totalRecommendedAmount`.

Then, print the `isChallengeComplete` variable.

```java
public class GreaterThanEqualTo {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      double recommendedWaterIntake = 8;
      double daysInChallenge = 30;
      double yourWaterIntake = 235.5;
      double totalRecommendedAmount = recommendedWaterIntake * daysInChallenge;
      boolean isChallengeComplete = yourWaterIntake >= totalRecommendedAmount;
      System.out.println(isChallengeComplete);
    }       
}
```
