# Compound Assignment Operators

```java
int number =Â 5; 

number += 3; // Value is now 8
number -= 4; // Value is now 4
number *= 6; // Value is now 24
number /= 2; // Value is now 12
number %= 7; // Value is now 5
```

Compound assignment operators can be used to change and reassign the value of a variable using one line of code. Compound assignment operators include `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`.
