# `final` Keyword

```java
// Value cannot be changed:
final double PI =Â 3.14;
```

The value of a variable cannot be changed if the variable was declared using the `final` keyword.

Note that the variable must be given a value when it is declared as `final`. `final` variables cannot be changed; any attempts at doing so will result in an error message.
