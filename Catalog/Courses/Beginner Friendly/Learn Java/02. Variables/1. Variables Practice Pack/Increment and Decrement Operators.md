# Increment and Decrement Operators

```java
int numApples = 5;num
Apples++; // Value is now 6

int numOranges = 5;num
Oranges--; // Value is now 4
```

The increment operator, (`++`), can increase the value of a number-based variable by `1` while the decrement operator, (`--`), can decrease the value of a variable by `1`.
