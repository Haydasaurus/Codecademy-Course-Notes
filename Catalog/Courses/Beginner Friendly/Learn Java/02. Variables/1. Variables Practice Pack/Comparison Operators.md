# Comparison Operators

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 3;

boolean result = a > b;
// result now holds the boolean value true
```

Comparison operators can be used to compare two values:

-   `>` greater than
-   `<` less than
-   `>=` greater than or equal to
-   `<=` less than or equal to
-   `==` equal to
-   `!=` not equal to

They are supported for primitive data types and the result of a comparison is a boolean value `true` or `false`.
