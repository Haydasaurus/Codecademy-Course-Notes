# Primitive Data Types

```java
int age = 28;  

char grade = 'A'; 

boolean late = true; 

byte b = 20; 

long num1 = 1234567; 

short no = 10; 

float k = (float)12.5; 

double pi = 3.14;
```

Java’s most basic data types are known as _primitive data types_ and are in the system by default.

The available types are as follows:

-   `int`
-   `char`
-   `boolean`
-   `byte`
-   `long`
-   `short`
-   `double`
-   `float`

`null` is another, but it can only ever store the value `null`.
