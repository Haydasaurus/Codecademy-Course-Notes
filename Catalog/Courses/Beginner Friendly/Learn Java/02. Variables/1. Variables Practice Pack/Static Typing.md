# Static Typing

```java
int i = 10;         // type is int
char ch = 'a';      // type is char 

j = 20;             // won't compile, no type is given
char name = "Lil";  // won't compile, wrong data type
```

In Java, the type of a variable is checked at compile time. This is known as _static typing_. It has the advantage of catching the errors at compile time rather than at execution time.

Variables must be declared with the appropriate data type or the program will not compile.
