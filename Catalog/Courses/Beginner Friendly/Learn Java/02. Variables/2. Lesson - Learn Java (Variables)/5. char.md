Learn Java: Variables
# char

How do we answer questions like: What grade did you get on the test? What letter does your name start with?

The `char` data type can hold any character, like a letter, space, or punctuation mark.

It must be surrounded by single quotes, `'`.

For example:

```java
char grade = 'A';
char firstLetter = 'p';
char punctuation = '!';
```

Exercise:

```java
public class Char {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   

	}
}
```

**1.** Create a variable called `expectedGrade` of type `char`.

Fill it with a single letter, representing the grade you think you would get in a graded Java course where the grades `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and `F` are possible

```java
public class Char {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		char expectedGrade = 'A';
	}
}
```

**2.** Print out your `expectedGrade` variable!

```java
public class Char {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		char expectedGrade = 'A';
		System.out.println(expectedGrade);
	}
}
```
