Learn Java: Variables
# doubles

Whole numbers don’t accomplish what we need for every program. What if we wanted to store the price of something? We need a decimal point. What if we wanted to store the world’s population? That number would be larger than the `int` type can hold.

The `double` primitive data type can help. `double` can hold decimals as well as very large and very small numbers. The maximum value is 1.797,693,134,862,315,7 E+308, which is approximately 17 followed by 307 zeros. The minimum value is 4.9 E-324, which is 324 decimal places!

To declare a variable of type `double`, we use the `double` keyword in the declaration:

```java
// doubles can have decimal places:
double price = 8.99;
// doubles can have values bigger than what an int could hold:
double gdp = 12237700000;
```

Exercise:

```java
public class MarketShare {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    
	}
}
```

**1.** As of 2016, Android has 81.7 percent of the market share for mobile operating systems. Create a variable called `androidShare` that holds this percentage as a double.

```java
public class MarketShare {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    double androidShare = 81.7;
	}
}
```

**2.** Print out `androidShare` to the console.

```java
public class MarketShare {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
      double androidShare = 81.7;
      System.out.println(androidShare);
	}
}
```
