# Local Variables

```java
public void exampleMethod(int exampleVariable){
  // exampleVariable can only be used inside these curly brackets.
}
```

In Java, local variables can only be used within the scope that they were defined in. This scope is often defined by a set of curly brackets. Variables canâ€™t be used outside of those brackets.
