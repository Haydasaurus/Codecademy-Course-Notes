# Mutator Methods

```java
public class CheckingAccount{
  private int balance;
  
  //A mutator method
  public void setBalance(int newBalance){
    this.balance = newBalance;
  }
}
```

In Java, mutator methods reset the value of a `private` variable. This gives other classes the ability to modify the value stored in that variable without having direct access to the variable itself.

Mutator methods take one parameter whose type matches the type of the variable it is modifying. Mutator methods usually donâ€™t return anything.
