# Compilation: Catching Errors

Java is a _compiled_ programming language, meaning the code we write in a **.java** file is transformed into _byte code_ by a compiler before it is executed by the Java Virtual Machine on your computer.

A compiler is a program that translates human-friendly programming languages into other programming languages that computers can execute.

![Steps of Java Compilation](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/revised-2019/Java%20M1L1-%20Compilation%20Process%20ART%20409.png)

Previous exercises have automatically compiled and run the files for you. Off-platform development environments can also compile and run files for you, but it’s important to understand this aspect of Java development so we’ll do it ourselves.

The compiling process catches mistakes **before** the computer runs our code.

The Java compiler runs a series of checks while it transforms the code. Code that does not pass these checks will not be compiled.

This exercise will use an interactive terminal. Codecademy has a [lesson on the command line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) if you’d like to learn more.

For example, with a file called **Plankton.java**, we could compile it with the terminal command:

```bash
javac Plankton.java
```

A successful compilation produces a **.class** file: **Plankton.class**, that we execute with the terminal command:

```bash
java Plankton
```

An unsuccessful compilation produces a list of errors. No **.class** file is made until the errors are corrected and the compile command is run again.

Exercise:

```java
public class Compiling {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");
    System.out.println("Java classes have a 'main' method.");
    System.out.println("Java statements end with a semicolon.")

    System.out.println("Programming is... fun!");
    
  }
}
```

**1.** Let’s practice compiling and executing a file by entering commands in the terminal!

Our text editor contains a broken program so we can see how compilers help us catch mistakes. **Don’t make any corrections!**

In the terminal, type this command: `javac Compiling.java` and press `enter` or `return`.

Then click the **Check Work** button to check your work and move on to the next checkpoint.

Hint: Running commands in the terminal is a little different from how we’ve executed code so far.
You’ll need to click into the terminal and type in the command.
Press `enter` or `return` when you’ve typed the full command.

```bash
javac Compiling.java
```

**2.** Do you see the error?

The compiler is telling us one of the print statements is missing a semicolon.

In the terminal, type `ls` and press return or enter.

`ls` is short for "list" and this command lists all the available files.

There is only one file: **Compiling.java**, we did not successfully compile the file because of the error.

Click the **Check Work** button to move on to the next checkpoint.

```bash
ls
```

**3.** Add the missing semicolon in the text editor, then click the **Check Work** button.

We’ll compile and execute this file in the next exercise!

Hint: The error message will tell you which line is missing a semicolon.

```java
public class Compiling {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");
    System.out.println("Java classes have a 'main' method.");
    System.out.println("Java statements end with a semicolon.");

    System.out.println("Programming is... fun!");
    
  }
}
```
