Hello World
# Semicolons and Whitespace

As we saw with comments, reading code is just as important as writing code.

We should write code that is easy for other people to read. Those people can be co-workers, friends, or even yourself!

Java does not interpret _whitespace_, the areas of the code without syntax, but humans use whitespace to read code without difficulty.

Functionally, these two code samples are identical:

```java
System.out.println("Java");System.out.println("Lava");System.out.println("Guava");
```

```java
System.out.println("Java");
 
System.out.println("Lava");
 
System.out.println("Guava");
```

They will print the same text to the screen, but which would you prefer to read? Imagine if it was hundreds of instructions! Whitespace would be essential.

Java **does** interpret semicolons. Semicolons are used to mark the end of a _statement_, one line of code that performs a single task.

The only statements we’ve seen so far are `System.out.println("My message!");`.

Let’s contrast statements with the curly brace, `{}`. Curly braces mark the scope of our classes and methods. There are no semicolons at the end of a curly brace.

Exercise:

```java
public class LanguageFacts {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Press enter or return on your keyboard after each semicolon!
    
    System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");System.out.println("Java classes have a 'main' method.");System.out.println("Java statements end with a semicolon.");
  }
}
```

**1.** The **LanguageFacts.java** file prints information about Java to the screen.

Unfortunately, the writer of the file has avoided using whitespace.

Make the file easier to read by adding a newline after each statement!

Hint: Enter a newline character by pressing `return` or `enter`.
You should see all the code after your cursor move down by one line.
```java
// Before entering a newline
System.out.println("Feels");System.out.println("Cramped!");
 
// Entering a newline after the first semicolon
System.out.println("Feels");
System.out.println("Cramped!");
```

```java
public class LanguageFacts {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Press enter or return on your keyboard after each semicolon!
    
    System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");
    System.out.println("Java classes have a 'main' method.");
    System.out.println("Java statements end with a semicolon.");
  }
}
```

**2.** Inside `main()`, add a new statement printing how you feel about coding.

Start the message with: “Programming is… “.

**Remember to place a semicolon at the end of the statement!**

```java
public class LanguageFacts {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Press enter or return on your keyboard after each semicolon!
    
    System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");
    System.out.println("Java classes have a 'main' method.");
    System.out.println("Java statements end with a semicolon.");
    System.out.println("Programming is fun.");
  }
}
```
