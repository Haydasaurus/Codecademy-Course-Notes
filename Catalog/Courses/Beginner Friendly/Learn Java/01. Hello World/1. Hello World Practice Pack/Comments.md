# Comments

```java
// I am a single line comment! 

/*And I am a 
multi-line comment!
*/
```

Comments are bits of text that are ignored by the compiler. They are used to increase the readability of a program.

-   Single line comments are created by using `//`.
-   Multi-line comments are created by starting with `/*` and ending with `*/`.
