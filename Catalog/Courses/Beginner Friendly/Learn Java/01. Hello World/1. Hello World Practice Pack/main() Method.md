# `main()` Method

```java
public class Person {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		System.out.println("Hello, world!");
		
	}
	
}
```

In Java, every application must contain a `main()` method, which is the entry point for the application. All other methods are invoked from the `main()` method.

The signature of the method is `public static void main(String[] args) { }`. It accepts a single argument: an array of elements of type `String`.
