# Compiling Java

```bash
# Compile the class file:
javac hello.java 

# Execute the compiled file:
java hello
```

In Java, when we compile a program, each individual class is converted into a **.class** file, which is known as byte code.

The JVM (Java virtual machine) is used to run the byte code.
