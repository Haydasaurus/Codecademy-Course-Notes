# Classes

```java
public class Person {    

	public static void main(String[] args) {        
	
		System.out.println("I am a person, not a computer.");      
		
	} 
	
}
```

A _class_ represents a single concept.

A Java program must have one class whose name is the same as the program filename.

In the example, the `Person` class must be declared in a program file named **Person.java**.
