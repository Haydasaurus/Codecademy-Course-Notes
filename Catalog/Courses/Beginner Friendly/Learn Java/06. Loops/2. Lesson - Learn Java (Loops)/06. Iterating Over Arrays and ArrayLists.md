Learn Java: Loops
# Iterating Over Arrays and ArrayLists

One common pattern we’ll encounter as a programmer is _traversing_, or looping, through a list of data and doing something with each item. In Java, that list would be an array or `ArrayList` and the loop could be a `for` loop. But wait, how does this work?

In order to traverse an array or `ArrayList` using a loop, we must find a way to access each element via its index. We may recall that `for` loops are created with a counter variable. We can use that counter to track the index of the current element as we iterate over the list of data.

Because the first index in an array or `ArrayList` is `0`, the counter would begin with a value of `0` and increment until the end of the list. So we can increment through the array or `ArrayList` using its indices.

For example, if we wanted to add `1` to every `int` item in an array `secretCode`, we could do this:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < secretCode.length; i++) {
  // Increase value of element value by 1
  secretCode[i] += 1;
}
```

Notice that our condition in this example is `i < secretCode.length`. Because array indices start at 0, the length of `secretCode` is 1 larger than its final index. A loop should stop its traversal before its counter variable is equal to the length of the list.

To give a concrete example, if the length of an array is `5`, the last index we want to access is `4`. If we were to try to access index `5`, we would get an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` error! This is a very common mistake when first starting to traverse arrays.

Traversing an `ArrayList` looks very similar:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < secretCode.size(); i++) {
  // Increase value of element value by 1
  int num = secretCode.get(i);
  secretCode.set(i, num + 1);
}
```

We can also use `while` loops to traverse through arrays and `ArrayList`s. If we use a `while` loop, we need to create our own counter variable to access individual elements. We’ll also set our condition to continue looping until our counter variable equals the list length.

For example, let’s use a `while` loop to traverse through an array:

```java
int i = 0; // initialize counter
 
while (i < secretCode.length) {
  secretCode[i] += 1;
  i++; // increment the while loop
}
```

Traversing through an `ArrayList` with a `while` loop would look like this:

```java
int i = 0; // initialize counter
 
while (i < secretCode.size()) {
  int num = secretCode.get(i);
  secretCode.set(i, num + 1);
  i++; // increment the while loop
}
```

Exercise:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class CalculateTotal {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    ArrayList<Double> expenses = new ArrayList<Double>();
    expenses.add(74.46);
    expenses.add(63.99);
    expenses.add(10.57);
    expenses.add(81.37);
    
    double total = 0;
    
    // Iterate over expenses
    
    
    System.out.println(total);
    
  }
  
}
```

**1.** Let’s use a `for` loop to iterate over `expenses` and sum up the `total` of all items.

Start with the skeleton of a `for` loop:

-   Initialize a counter `i` with a value of `0`.
-   The loop should run while `i` is less than the `size()` of `expenses`.
-   Increment `i`.

You can leave the body empty for now.

Hint: Remember, `expenses` is an `ArrayList`. You can find the size of an `ArrayList` using `.size()`.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class CalculateTotal {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    ArrayList<Double> expenses = new ArrayList<Double>();
    expenses.add(74.46);
    expenses.add(63.99);
    expenses.add(10.57);
    expenses.add(81.37);
    
    double total = 0;
    
    // Iterate over expenses
    for (int i = 0; i < expenses.size(); i++) {
      
    }
    
    System.out.println(total);
    
  }
  
}
```

**2.** Inside the `for` loop, add the item’s value to `total`.

Hint: You can get the value of the current item in a list like this:
```java
secretCode.get(i);
```

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class CalculateTotal {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    ArrayList<Double> expenses = new ArrayList<Double>();
    expenses.add(74.46);
    expenses.add(63.99);
    expenses.add(10.57);
    expenses.add(81.37);
    
    double total = 0;
    
    // Iterate over expenses
    for (int i = 0; i < expenses.size(); i++) {
      total += expenses.get(i);
    }
    
    System.out.println(total);
    
  }
  
}
```
