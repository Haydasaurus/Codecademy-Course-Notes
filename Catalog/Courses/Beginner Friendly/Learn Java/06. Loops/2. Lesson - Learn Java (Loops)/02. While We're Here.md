Learn Java: Loops
# While We're Here

A `while` loop looks a bit like an `if` statement:

```java
while (silliness > 10) {
 
  // code to run
 
}
```

Like an `if` statement, the code inside a `while` loop will only run if the condition is `true`. However, a `while` loop will continue running the code over and over until the condition evaluates to `false`. So the code block will repeat until `silliness` is less than or equal to 10.

```java
// set attempts to 0
int attempts = 0;
 
// enter loop if condition is true
while (passcode != 0524 && attempts < 4) {
 
  System.out.println("Try again.");
  passcode = getNewPasscode();
  attempts += 1;
 
  // is condition still true?
  // if so, repeat code block
}
// exit when condition is not true
```

`while` loops are extremely useful when you want to run some code until a specific change happens. However, if you aren’t certain that change will occur, beware the infinite loop!

_Infinite loops_ occur when the condition will never evaluate to `false`. This can cause your entire program to crash.

```java
int hedgehogs = 5;
 
// This will cause an infinite loop:
while (hedgehogs < 6) {
 
  System.out.println("Not enough hedgehogs!");
 
}
```

In the example above, `hedgehogs` remains equal to `5`, which is less than `6`. So we would get an infinite loop.

Exercise:

```java
// Importing the Random library
import java.util.Random;

class LuckyFive {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // Creating a random number generator
    Random randomGenerator = new Random();
    
    // Generate a number between 1 and 6
    int dieRoll = randomGenerator.nextInt(6) + 1;

    // Repeat while roll isn't 5
    
    
  }
  
}
```

**1.** Take a look at **LuckyFive.java**. We’ve set up a random number generator that allows you to simulate the roll of a die.

Create a `while` loop that will continue to loop while `dieRoll` is NOT `5`.

**Do NOT run your code yet** — you will get an infinite loop here because the value of `dieRoll` is never changed.

Inside the loop, reset `dieRoll` with a new random value between `1` and `6`.

Now you can run the code.

Hint: To repeat code while the value of `x` is not equal to `3`:
```java
while (x != 3) {
 
  // code goes here
 
}
```

To reset `dieRoll` to a new number between `1` and `6`:
```java
dieRoll = randomGenerator.nextInt(6) + 1;
```

```java
// Importing the Random library
import java.util.Random;

class LuckyFive {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // Creating a random number generator
    Random randomGenerator = new Random();
    
    // Generate a number between 1 and 6
    int dieRoll = randomGenerator.nextInt(6) + 1;

    // Repeat while roll isn't 5
    while (dieRoll != 5) {
      dieRoll = randomGenerator.nextInt(6) + 1;
    }
    
  }
  
}
```

**2.** Inside the `while` loop, above the line where you reset `dieRoll`, print out `dieRoll` to the terminal.

```java
// Importing the Random library
import java.util.Random;

class LuckyFive {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // Creating a random number generator
    Random randomGenerator = new Random();
    
    // Generate a number between 1 and 6
    int dieRoll = randomGenerator.nextInt(6) + 1;

    // Repeat while roll isn't 5
    while (dieRoll != 5) {
      System.out.println(dieRoll);
      dieRoll = randomGenerator.nextInt(6) + 1;
    }
    
  }
  
}
```
