# Incrementing While Loops

When looping through code, it’s common to use a counter variable. A _counter_ (also known as an _iterator_) is a variable used in the conditional logic of the loop and (usually) incremented in value during each iteration through the code. For example:

```java
// counter is initialized
int wishes = 0;
 
// conditional logic uses counter
while (wishes < 3) {
 
  System.out.println("Wish granted.");
  // counter is incremented
  wishes++;
 
}
```

In the above example, the counter `wishes` gets initialized before the loop with a value of `0`, then the program will keep printing `"Wish granted."` and adding `1` to `wishes` as long as `wishes` has a value of less than `3`. Once `wishes` reaches a value of `3` or more, the program will exit the loop.

So the output would look like:

```
Wish granted.
Wish granted.
Wish granted.
```

We can also decrement counters like this:

```java
int pushupsToDo = 10;
 
while (pushupsToDo > 0) {
 
  doPushup();
  pushupsToDo--;
 
}
```

In the code above, the counter, `pushupsToDo`, starts at 10, and increments down one at a time. When it hits 0, the loop exits.

Exercise:

```java
class Coffee {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // initialize cupsOfCoffee
    
    // add while loop with counter
    
        
    
  }
  
}
```

**1.** In **Coffee.java**, initialize an `int` variable called `cupsOfCoffee` with a value of `1`.

Hint: For example, to initialize `eyes` with a value of `2`:
```java
int eyes = 2;
```

```java
class Coffee {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // initialize cupsOfCoffee
    int cupsOfCoffee = 1;
    
    // add while loop with counter
    
        
    
  }
  
}
```

**2.** Create a `while` loop that runs as long as `cupsOfCoffee` is less than or equal to `100`.

**Important:** Inside the `while` loop, increment `cupsOfCoffee` by `1` to prevent an infinite loop.

Hint: To run a `while` loop as long as `kittens` is less than or equal to `6` with `kittens` incrementing on each iteration:
```java
while (kittens <= 6) {
 
  kittens++;
 
}
```

```java
class Coffee {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // initialize cupsOfCoffee
    int cupsOfCoffee = 1;

    // add while loop with counter
    while (cupsOfCoffee <= 100) {
      cupsOfCoffee ++;
    }
        
    
  }
  
}
```

**3.** Inside the `while` loop above where you incremented `cupsOfCoffee` print the following:

```
Fry drinks cup of coffee #1
```

The `1` in this statement should correspond with the current value of `cupsOfCoffee`. When `cupsOfCoffee` is `100`, this should be printed:

```
Fry drinks cup of coffee #100
```

Hint: To print a `String` with a variable value:
```java
System.out.println("I have " + kittens + " kittens");
```

```java
class Coffee {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // initialize cupsOfCoffee
    int cupsOfCoffee = 1;

    // add while loop with counter
    while (cupsOfCoffee <= 100) {
      System.out.println("Fry drinks cup of coffee #" + cupsOfCoffee);
      cupsOfCoffee ++;
    }
        
    
  }
  
}
```
