Conditionals and Control Flow
# If-Then-Else

We’ve seen how to conditionally execute one block of code, but what if there are two possible blocks of code we’d like to execute?

Let’s say _if_ a student has the required prerequisite, _then_ they enroll in the selected course, _else_ they’re enrolled in the prerequisite course instead.

We create an alternate conditional branch with the `else` keyword:

```java
if (hasPrerequisite) {
 
  // Enroll in course
 
} else {
 
  // Enroll in prerequisite
 
}
```

This conditional statement ensures that exactly one code block will be run. If the condition, `hasPrerequisite`, is `false`, the block after `else` runs.

There are now two separate code blocks in our conditional statement. The first block runs if the condition evaluates to `true`, the second block runs if the condition evaluates to `false`.

This code is also called an _if-then-else_ statement:

-   If _condition_ is true, then do something.
-   Else, do a different thing.

Exercise: 

```java
public class Order {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    boolean isFilled = false;
    
    // Write an if-then-else statement:
    
    
  }
  
}
```

**1.** In the code editor, there is an `isFilled` value, that represents whether the order is ready to ship.

Write an if-then-else statement that:

-   When `isFilled` is `true`, print `Shipping`.
-   When `isFilled` is `false`, print `Order not ready`.

Hint: Here’s the structure of an `if-then-else` conditional statement:
```java
if (condition) {
 
  // Do one thing
 
} else {
 
  // Do another thing
 
}
```

```java
public class Order {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    boolean isFilled = false;
    
    // Write an if-then-else statement:
    if (isFilled) {
      System.out.println("Shipping");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Order not ready");
    }
    
  }
  
}
```
