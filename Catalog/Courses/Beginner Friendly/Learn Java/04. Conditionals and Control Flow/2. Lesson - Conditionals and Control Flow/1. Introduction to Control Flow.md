Conditionals and Control Flow
# Introduction to Control Flow

Imagine we’re writing a program that enrolls students in courses.

-   _If_ a student has completed the prerequisites, _then_ they can enroll in a course.
-   _Else_, they need to take the prerequisite courses.

They can’t take Physics II without finishing Physics I.

We represent this kind of decision-making in our program using _conditional_ or _control flow_ statements. Before this point, our code runs line-by-line from the top down, but conditional statements allow us to be selective in which portions will run.

Conditional statements check a `boolean` condition and run a _block_ of code depending on the condition. Curly braces mark the scope of a conditional block similar to a method or class.

Here’s a complete conditional statement:

```java
if (true) {
 
  System.out.println("Hello World!");
 
}
```

If the condition is `true`, then the block is run. So `Hello World!` is printed.

But suppose the condition is different:

```java
if (false) {
 
  System.out.println("Hello World!");
 
}
```

If the condition is `false`, then the block does not run.

This code is also called _if-then_ statements: “If `(condition)` is `true`, then do something”.
