Conditionals and Control Flow
# Nested Conditional Statements

We can create more complex conditional structures by creating _nested conditional statements_, which is created by placing conditional statements inside other conditional statements:

```pseudo
if (outer condition) {
  if (nested condition) {
    Instruction to execute if both conditions are true
  }
}
```

When we implement nested conditional statements, the outer statement is evaluated first. If the outer condition is `true`, then the inner, nested statement is evaluated.

Let’s create a program that helps us decide what to wear based on the weather:

```java
int temp = 45;
boolean raining = true;
 
if (temp < 60) {
  System.out.println("Wear a jacket!");
  if (raining == true) {
    System.out.println("Bring your umbrella.");
  } else {
    System.out.println("Leave your umbrella home.");
  }
}
```

In the code snippet above, our compiler will check the condition in the first `if-then` statement: `temp < 60`. Since `temp` has a value of `45`, this condition is `true`; therefore, our program will print `Wear a jacket!`.

Then, we’ll evaluate the condition of the nested `if-then` statement: `raining == true`. This condition is also `true`, so `Bring your umbrella` is also printed to the screen.

Note that, if the first condition was `false`, the nested condition would not be evaluated.

Exercise:

```java
public class Order {
  boolean isFilled;
  double billAmount;
  String shipping;
  String couponCode;
  
  public Order(boolean filled, double cost, String shippingMethod, String coupon) {
		if (cost > 24.00) {
      System.out.println("High value item!");
    }
    isFilled = filled;
    billAmount = cost;
    shipping = shippingMethod;
    couponCode = coupon;
  }
  
  public void ship() {
    if (isFilled) {
      System.out.println("Shipping");
      System.out.println("Shipping cost: " + calculateShipping());
    } else {
      System.out.println("Order not ready");
    }
  }
  
  public double calculateShipping() {
    if (shipping.equals("Regular")) {
      return 0;
    } else if (shipping.equals("Express")) {
      // Add your code here

      
    } else {
      return .50;
    }
 	}
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // do not alter the main method!
    Order book = new Order(true, 9.99, "Express", "ship50");
    Order chemistrySet = new Order(false, 72.50, "Regular", "freeShipping");
    
    book.ship();
    chemistrySet.ship();
  }
}
```

**1.** The company offers a temporary deal that, if the consumer uses the coupon `"ship50"`, the company will reduce the express shipping price.

Let’s rewrite the body of `else`-`if` statement from the last exercise. Inside the `else`-`if` statement, create a nested `if-then` statement that checks if `couponCode` equals `"ship50"`.

If the nested condition is `true`, return the value `.85`.

If the condition is `false`, use a nested `else` statement to return the value `1.75`.

Hint: The solution should look similar to the example below:
```java
public double calculateShipping() {
  if (shipping.equals("Regular")) {
    return 0;
  } else if (shipping.equals("Express")) {
    // Add your code here
    if (couponCode.equals("couponCodeValue")) {
      // return discounted shipping value
    } else {
      // return full shipping value
    }
  } else {
    return .50;
  }
}
```

```java
public class Order {
  boolean isFilled;
  double billAmount;
  String shipping;
  String couponCode;
  
  public Order(boolean filled, double cost, String shippingMethod, String coupon) {
		if (cost > 24.00) {
      System.out.println("High value item!");
    }
    isFilled = filled;
    billAmount = cost;
    shipping = shippingMethod;
    couponCode = coupon;
  }
  
  public void ship() {
    if (isFilled) {
      System.out.println("Shipping");
      System.out.println("Shipping cost: " + calculateShipping());
    } else {
      System.out.println("Order not ready");
    }
  }
  
  public double calculateShipping() {
    if (shipping.equals("Regular")) {
      return 0;
    } else if (shipping.equals("Express")) {
      // Add your code here
      if (couponCode.equals("ship50")) {
        return .85;
      } else {
        return 1.75;
      }
      
    } else {
      return .50;
    }
 	}
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // do not alter the main method!
    Order book = new Order(true, 9.99, "Express", "ship50");
    Order chemistrySet = new Order(false, 72.50, "Regular", "freeShipping");
    
    book.ship();
    chemistrySet.ship();
  }
}
```
