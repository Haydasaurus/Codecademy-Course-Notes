Conditionals and Control Flow
# If-Then Statement

The _if-then_ statement is the most simple control flow we can write. It tests an expression for truth and executes some code based on it.

```java
if (flip == 1) {
 
  System.out.println("Heads!");
 
}
```

-   The `if` keyword marks the beginning of the conditional statement, followed by parentheses `()`.
-   The parentheses hold a `boolean` datatype.

For the condition in parentheses we can also use variables that reference a boolean, or comparisons that evaluate to a boolean.

The boolean condition is followed by opening and closing curly braces that mark a block of code. This block runs if, and only if, the boolean is `true`.

```java
boolean isValidPassword = true;
 
if (isValidPassword) {
 
  System.out.println("Password accepted!");
 
}
 
// Prints "Password accepted!"
 
int numberOfItemsInCart = 9;
 
if (numberOfItemsInCart > 12) {
 
  System.out.println("Express checkout not available");
 
}
 
// Nothing is printed.
```

If a conditional is brief we can omit the curly braces entirely:

```java
if (true) System.out.println("Brevity is the soul of wit");
```

**Note:** Conditional statements do not end in a semicolon.

Exercise:

```java
public class Order {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    double itemCost = 30.99;
    
    // Write an if-then statement:
    
    
  }
  
}
```

**1.** The code editor contains an `Order` class to track retail shipments.

Write an `if-then` statement that prints `High value item!` when `itemCost` is greater than `24.00`.

Hint: Hereâ€™s the general structure:
```java
if (condition) {
 
  // Do something
 
}
```

```java
public class Order {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    double itemCost = 30.99;
    
    // Write an if-then statement:
    if (itemCost > 24.00) {
      System.out.println("High value item!");
    }
    
  }
  
}
```
