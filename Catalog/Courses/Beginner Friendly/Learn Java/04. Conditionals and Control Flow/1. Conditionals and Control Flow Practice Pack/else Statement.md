# else Statement

```java
boolean condition1 = false;
 
if (condition1){
    System.out.println("condition1 is true");
}
else{
    System.out.println("condition1 is not true");
}
// Prints: condition1 is not true
```

The `else` statement executes a block of code when the condition inside the `if` statement is `false`. The `else` statement is always the last condition.
