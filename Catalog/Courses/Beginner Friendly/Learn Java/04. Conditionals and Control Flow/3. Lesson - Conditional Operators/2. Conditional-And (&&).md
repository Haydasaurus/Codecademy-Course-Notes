Conditional Operators
# Conditional-And: &&

Let’s return to our student enrollment program. We’ve added an additional requirement: not only must students have the prerequisite, but their tuition must be paid up as well. We have _two_ conditions that must be `true` before we enroll the student.

Here’s one way we could write the code:

```java
if (tuitionPaid) {
  if (hasPrerequisite) {
    // enroll student
  }
}
```

We’ve nested two `if-then` statements. This does the job but we can be more concise with the _AND_ operator:

```java
if (tuitionPaid && hasPrerequisite) {
  // enroll student
}
```

The AND operator, `&&`, is used between two boolean values and evaluates to a single boolean value. If the values **on both sides** are `true`, then the resulting value is `true`, otherwise the resulting value is `false`.

This code illustrates every combination:

```java
true && true
// true
false && true
// false
true && false
// false
false && false
// false
```

Exercise:

```java
public class Reservation {
  int guestCount;
  int restaurantCapacity;
  boolean isRestaurantOpen;
  boolean isConfirmed;
  
  public Reservation(int count, int capacity, boolean open) {
    guestCount = count;
		restaurantCapacity = capacity;
		isRestaurantOpen = open;
  }  
  
  public void confirmReservation() {
    /* 
       Write conditional
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       if restaurantCapacity is greater
       or equal to guestCount
       AND
       the restaurant is open:
         print "Reservation confirmed"
         set isConfirmed to true
       else:
         print "Reservation denied"
         set isConfirmed to false
    */
  }
  
  public void informUser() {
    System.out.println("Please enjoy your meal!");
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Reservation partyOfThree = new Reservation(3, 12, true);
    Reservation partyOfFour = new Reservation(4, 3, true);
    partyOfThree.confirmReservation();
    partyOfThree.informUser();
    partyOfFour.confirmReservation();
    partyOfFour.informUser();
  }
}
```

**1.** Our `Reservation` class has the method `confirmReservation()` which validates if a restaurant can accomodate a given reservation.

We need to build the conditional logic into `confirmReservation()` using two parameters:

-   `restaurantCapacity`
-   `isRestaurantOpen`

Use an `if-then-else` statement:

If `restaurantCapacity` is greater than or equal to `guestCount` **and** the restaurant is open, print `"Reservation confirmed"` and set `isConfirmed` to `true`.

`else` print `"Reservation denied"` and set `isConfirmed` to `false`.

```java
public class Reservation {
  int guestCount;
  int restaurantCapacity;
  boolean isRestaurantOpen;
  boolean isConfirmed;
  
  public Reservation(int count, int capacity, boolean open) {
    guestCount = count;
		restaurantCapacity = capacity;
		isRestaurantOpen = open;
  }  
  
  public void confirmReservation() {
    /* 
       Write conditional
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       if restaurantCapacity is greater
       or equal to guestCount
       AND
       the restaurant is open:
         print "Reservation confirmed"
         set isConfirmed to true
       else:
         print "Reservation denied"
         set isConfirmed to false
    */

    if (restaurantCapacity >= guestCount && isRestaurantOpen) {
      System.out.println("Reservation confirmed.");
      isConfirmed = true;
    } else {
      System.out.println("Reservation denied.");
      isConfirmed = false;
    }
  }
  
  public void informUser() {
    System.out.println("Please enjoy your meal!");
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Reservation partyOfThree = new Reservation(3, 12, true);
    Reservation partyOfFour = new Reservation(4, 3, true);
    partyOfThree.confirmReservation();
    partyOfThree.informUser();
    partyOfFour.confirmReservation();
    partyOfFour.informUser();
  }
}
```
