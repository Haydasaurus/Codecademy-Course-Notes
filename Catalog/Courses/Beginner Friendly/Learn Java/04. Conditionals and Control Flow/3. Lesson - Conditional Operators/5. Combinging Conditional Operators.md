Conditional Operators
# Combining Conditional Operators

We have the ability to expand our boolean expressions by using multiple conditional operators in a single expression.

For example:

```java
boolean foo = true && !(false || !true)
```

How does an expression like this get evaluated by the compiler? The order of evaluation when it comes to conditional operators is as follows:

1.  Conditions placed in parentheses - `()`
2.  NOT - `!`
3.  AND - `&&`
4.  OR - `||`

Using this information, let’s dissect the expression above to find the value of `foo`:

```java
true && !(false || !true)
```

First, we’ll evaluate `(false || !true`) because it is enclosed within parentheses. Following the order of evaluation, we will evaluate `!true`, which equals `false`:

```java
true && !(false || false)
```

Then, we’ll evaluate `(false || false)` which equals `false`. Now our expression looks like this:

```java
true && !false
```

Next, we’ll evaluate `!false` because it uses the NOT operator. This expression equals `true` making our expression the following:

```java
true && true
```

`true && true` evaluates to `true`; therefore, the value of `foo` is `true`.

Exercise:

```java
public class Operators {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 6;
    int b = 3;

    boolean ex1 = !(a == 7 && (b >= a || a != a));
    // System.out.println(ex1);

    boolean ex2 = a == b || !(b > 3);
    // System.out.println(ex2);

    boolean ex3 = !(b <= a && b != a + b);
    // System.out.println(ex3); 

  }
}
```

Take a look at the three expressions in **Operators.java**.

Using your understanding of the order of execution, find out whether the value of each expression is `true` or `false`.

When you’re ready, uncomment the print statements to find out if you are right.

```java
public class Operators {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 6;
    int b = 3;

    boolean ex1 = !(a == 7 && (b >= a || a != a));
    System.out.println(ex1); //true

    boolean ex2 = a == b || !(b > 3);
    System.out.println(ex2); //true

    boolean ex3 = !(b <= a && b != a + b);
    System.out.println(ex3); //false

  }
}
```
