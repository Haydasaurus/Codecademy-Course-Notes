Conditional Operators
# Conditional-Or: ||

The requirements of our enrollment program have changed again. Certain courses have prerequisites that are satisfied by multiple courses. As long as students have taken **at least one** prerequisite, they should be allowed to enroll.

Here’s one way we could write the code:

```java
if (hasAlgebraPrerequisite) {
  // Enroll in course
}
 
if (hasGeometryPrerequisite) {
  // Enroll in course
}
```

We’re using two different `if-then` statements with **the same code block**. We can be more concise with the _OR_ operator:

```java
if (hasAlgebraPrerequisite || hasGeometryPrerequisite) {
  // Enroll in course
}
```

The OR operator, `||`, is used between two boolean values and evaluates to a single boolean value. If **either of the two values** is `true`, then the resulting value is `true`, otherwise the resulting value is `false`.

This code illustrates every combination:

```java
true || true
// true
false || true
// true
true || false
// true
false || false
// false
```

On some occasions, the compiler can determine the truth value of a logical expression by only evaluating the first `boolean` operand; this is known as _short-circuited evaluation_. Short-circuited evaluation only works with expressions that use `&&` or `||`.

In an expression that uses `||`, the resulting value will be `true` as long as one of the operands has a `true` value. If the first operand of an expression is `true`, we don’t need to see what the value of the other operand is to know that the final value will also be `true`.

For example, we can run the following code without error despite dividing a number by `0` in the second operand because the first operand had a `true` value:

```java
if (1 > 0 || 2 / 0 == 7) {
  System.out.println("No errors here!");
}
```

An expression that uses `&&` will only result in `true` if both operands are `true`. If the first operand in the expression is `false`, the entire value will be `false`.

Exercise:

```java
public class Reservation {
  int guestCount;
  int restaurantCapacity;
  boolean isRestaurantOpen;
  boolean isConfirmed;
  
  public Reservation(int count, int capacity, boolean open) {
    // Write conditional statement below
    
    
    guestCount = count;
		restaurantCapacity = capacity;
		isRestaurantOpen = open;
  }  
  
  public void confirmReservation() {
    if (restaurantCapacity >= guestCount && isRestaurantOpen) {
      System.out.println("Reservation confirmed");
      isConfirmed = true;
    } else {
      System.out.println("Reservation denied");
			isConfirmed = false;
    }
  }
  
  public void informUser() {
    System.out.println("Please enjoy your meal!");
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Reservation partyOfThree = new Reservation(3, 12, true);
    Reservation partyOfFour = new Reservation(4, 3, true);
    partyOfThree.confirmReservation();
    partyOfThree.informUser();
    partyOfFour.confirmReservation();
    partyOfFour.informUser();
  }
}
```

**1.** Let’s write a message inside the `Reservation()` constructor that warns against bad input.

Our restaurants can’t seat parties of more than `8` people, and we don’t want reservations for `0` or less because that would be silly.

Inside `Reservation()`, write a conditional that uses `||`.

If `count` is less than `1` **OR** greater than `8` we want to write the following message: `Invalid reservation!`.

Hint: The conditional-OR, `||`, evaluates to `true` if **at least one** of the values are `true`. We can use it in a conditional statement like so:
```java
boolean lightGreen = false;
boolean lightYellow = true;
 
if (lightGreen || lightYellow) {
  System.out.println("You may pass");
}
```

This code snippet will print `You may pass` because one of the two booleans, `lightYellow`, is `true`.

```java
public class Reservation {
  int guestCount;
  int restaurantCapacity;
  boolean isRestaurantOpen;
  boolean isConfirmed;
  
  public Reservation(int count, int capacity, boolean open) {
    // Write conditional statement below


    guestCount = count;
	restaurantCapacity = capacity;
	isRestaurantOpen = open;

    if (count < 1 || count > 8) {
    System.out.println("Invalid reservation!");
    }
  }  
  
  public void confirmReservation() {
    if (restaurantCapacity >= guestCount && isRestaurantOpen) {
      System.out.println("Reservation confirmed");
      isConfirmed = true;
    } else {
      System.out.println("Reservation denied");
			isConfirmed = false;
    }
  }
  
  public void informUser() {
    System.out.println("Please enjoy your meal!");
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Reservation partyOfThree = new Reservation(3, 12, true);
    Reservation partyOfFour = new Reservation(4, 3, true);
    partyOfThree.confirmReservation();
    partyOfThree.informUser();
    partyOfFour.confirmReservation();
    partyOfFour.informUser();
  }
}
```
