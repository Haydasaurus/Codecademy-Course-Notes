Conditional Operators
# Introduction to Conditional Operators

Java includes operators that only use boolean values. These _conditional operators_ help simplify expressions containing complex boolean relationships by reducing multiple boolean values to a single value: `true` or `false`.

For example, what if we want to run a code block only if _multiple_ conditions are true. We could use the _AND_ operator: `&&`.

Or, we want to run a code block if _at least one_ of two conditions are `true`. We could use the _OR_ operator: `||`.

Finally, we can produce the opposite value, where `true` becomes `false` and `false` becomes `true`, with the _NOT_ operator: `!`.

Understanding these complex relationships can feel overwhelming at first. Luckily, _truth tables_, like the ones seen to the right, can assist us in determining the relationship between two boolean-based conditions.

In this lesson, we’ll explore each of these conditional operators to see how they can be implemented into our conditional statements.

![Three truth tables are displayed: AND, OR, and NOT
Each truth table is divided into three columns. The first column shows the true or false value of 'a'. The second column shows the true or false value of 'b'. The third c.olumn shows a true or false value that represents the relationship between 'a' and 'b'.](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/AP-Computer-Science-A/conditional-operators/TruthTable-All.svg)

Exercise:

```java
public class Reservation {
  int guestCount;
  int restaurantCapacity;
  boolean isRestaurantOpen;
  boolean isConfirmed;
  
  public Reservation(int count, int capacity, boolean open) {
    if (count < 1 || count > 8) {
      System.out.println("Invalid reservation!");
    }
    guestCount = count;
		restaurantCapacity = capacity;
		isRestaurantOpen = open;
  }  
  
  public void confirmReservation() {
    if (restaurantCapacity >= guestCount && isRestaurantOpen) {
      System.out.println("Reservation confirmed");
      isConfirmed = true;
    } else {
      System.out.println("Reservation denied");
			isConfirmed = false;
    }
  }
  
  public void informUser() {
    if (!isConfirmed) {
      System.out.println("Unable to confirm reservation, please contact restaurant.");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Please enjoy your meal!");
    }
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Reservation partyOfThree = new Reservation(3, 12, true);
    Reservation partyOfFour = new Reservation(4, 3, true);
    partyOfThree.confirmReservation();
    partyOfThree.informUser();
    partyOfFour.confirmReservation();
    partyOfFour.informUser();
  }
}
```

The text editor contains a `Reservation` class we’ll build in this lesson.

Note the different conditional statements and operators that we’re using to control the execution of the program.

Move on when you’re ready!
