# Inheritance in Java

```java
// Parent Class
class Animal {
  // Animal class members
}
 
// Child Class
class Dog extends Animal {
  // Dog inherits traits from Animal 
  
  // additional Dog class members
}
```

_Inheritance_ is an important feature of object-oriented programming in Java. It allows for one class (_child class_) to inherit the fields and methods of another class (_parent class_). For instance, we might want a child class `Dog` to inherent traits from a more general parent class `Animal`.

When defining a child class in Java, we use the keyword `extends` to inherit from a parent class.
