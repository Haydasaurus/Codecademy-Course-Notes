Java: Introduction to Classes
# Classes: Syntax

The fundamental concept of object-oriented programming is the class.

A _class_ is the set of instructions that describe how an instance can behave and what information it contains.

Java has pre-defined classes such as `System`, which we’ve used in logging text to our screen, but we also need to write our own classes for the custom needs of a program.

Here’s a definition of a Java class:

```java
public class Car {
// scope of Car class starts after curly brace
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // scope of main() starts after curly brace
 
    // program tasks
 
  }
  // scope of main() ends after curly brace
 
}
// scope of Car class ends after curly brace
```

This example defines a `class` named `Car`. `public` is an _access level modifier_ that allows **other** classes to interact with this class. For now, all classes will be `public`.

This class has a `main()` method, which lists the tasks performed by the program. `main()` runs when we execute the compiled **Car.class** file.

Exercise:

```Java

```

**1.** In the code editor, create a `public` `Store` class.

Hint: Refer to the example in the narrative if you need help.

```java
public class Store {
  
}
```

**2.** Your program will not compile without a `main()` method.

Define one within `Store`.

```java
public class Store {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

  }
}
```
