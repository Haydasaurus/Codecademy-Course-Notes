Java: Introduction to Classes
# Introduction to Classes

All programs require one or more classes that act as a model for the world.

For example, a program to track student test scores might have `Student`, `Course`, and `Grade` classes. Our real-world concerns, students and their grades, are inside the program as classes.

We represent each student as an _instance_, or _object_, of the `Student` class.

This is _object-oriented programming_ because programs are built around objects and their interactions. An object contains state and behavior.

Classes are a blueprint for objects. Blueprints detail the general structure. For example, all students have an ID, all courses can enroll a student, etc.

An instance is the thing itself. _This_ student has an ID of `42`, _this_ course enrolled _that_ student, etc.

Let’s review with another example, a savings account at a bank.

What should a savings account know?

-   The balance of money available.

What should a savings account do?

-   Deposit money.
-   Withdraw money.

![Diagram of a Savings Account as software object](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/revised-2019/diagram%20of%20an%20object-02.png)

Imagine two people have accounts that are instances of the `SavingsAccount` class. They share behavior (how they deposit and withdraw) but have individual state (their balances), and even with the same balance amount these accounts are separate entities.

Exercise:

```java
public class Store {
  // instance fields
  String productType;
  int inventoryCount;
  double inventoryPrice;
  
  // constructor method
  public Store(String product, int count, double price) {
    productType = product;
    inventoryCount = count;
    inventoryPrice = price;
  }
  
  // main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Store lemonadeStand = new Store("lemonade", 42, .99);
    Store cookieShop = new Store("cookies", 12, 3.75);
    
    System.out.println("Our first shop sells " + lemonadeStand.productType + " at " + lemonadeStand.inventoryPrice + " per unit.");
    
    System.out.println("Our second shop has " + cookieShop.inventoryCount + " units remaining.");
  }
}
```
