Java: Introduction to Classes
# Classes: Instance Fields

Our last exercise ended with printing an instance of `Store`, which looked something like `Store@6bc7c054`. The first part, `Store`, refers to the class, and the second part `@6bc7c054` refers to the instance’s location in the computer’s memory.

We don’t care about memory location, but our instances have no other characteristics! When an object is created, the constructor sets the initial state of the object. The _state_ is made up of associated data that represents the characteristics of an object.

We’ll add data to an object by introducing _instance variables_, or _instance fields_.

We want `Car` instances of different colors, so we declare a `String color` instance field. Often times, instance variables are described as a “has-a” relationship with the object. For example, a `Car` “has-a” `color`. Another way to think of this is that instance variables are the nouns and adjectives associated with an object. What qualities other than `color` might a car _have_?

```java
public class Car {
  /*
  declare fields inside the class
  by specifying the type and name
  */
  String color;
 
  public Car() {
    /* 
    instance fields available in
    scope of constructor method
    */
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // body of main method
  }
}
```

The declaration is **within** the class and the instance variable will be available for assignment inside the constructor.

Fields are a type of state each instance will possess. One instance may have `"red"` as its `color`, another `"blue"`, etc. It’s the job of the constructor to give these instance fields initial value. We’ll learn how to do this in the next exercise.

Exercise:

```java
public class Store {
  // declare instance fields here!
  
  
  // constructor method
  public Store() {
    System.out.println("I am inside the constructor method.");
  }
  
  // main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("This code is inside the main method.");
    
    Store lemonadeStand = new Store();
    
    System.out.println(lemonadeStand);
  }
}
```

**1.** Add some state to our `Store` class.

Declare a `String` instance field for `productType`.

Hint: Declare instance fields within the curly braces of the class, but outside any method. For example, given the class `Dog`:
```java
public Dog {
  // no instance fields
 
  public Dog() {
    // body of Dog constructor
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // just dog things...
  }
}
```

We can add the instance field `breed` of type `String` like so:
```java
public Dog {
  // instance field
  String breed;
 
  public Dog() {
    // body of Dog constructor
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // just dog things...
  }
}
```

```java
public class Store {
  // declare instance fields here!
  String productType;
  
  // constructor method
  public Store() {
    System.out.println("I am inside the constructor method.");
  }
  
  // main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("This code is inside the main method.");
    
    Store lemonadeStand = new Store();
    
    System.out.println(lemonadeStand);
  }
}
```
