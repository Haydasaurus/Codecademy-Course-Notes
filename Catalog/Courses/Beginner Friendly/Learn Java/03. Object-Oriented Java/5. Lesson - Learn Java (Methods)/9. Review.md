Learn Java: Methods
# Review

Great work! Methods are a powerful way to abstract tasks away and make them repeatable. They allow us to define behavior for classes, so that the Objects we create can do the things we expect them to. Let’s review everything we have learned about methods so far.

-   _Defining a method_ : Method declarations will declare a method’s return type, name, and parameters
-   _Calling a method_ : Methods are invoked with a `.` and `()`
-   _Parameters_ : Inputs to the method and their types are declared in parentheses in the method signature
-   _Changing Instance Fields_ : Methods can be used to change the value of an instance field
-   _Scope_ : Variables only exist within the domain that they are created in
-   _Return_ : The type of the variables that will be output are declared in the method declaration

As you move through more Java material, it will be helpful to frame the tasks you create in terms of methods. This will help you think about what inputs you might need and what output you expect.

Exercise:

```java
public class SavingsAccount {
  
  int balance;
  
  public SavingsAccount(int initialBalance){
    balance = initialBalance;
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    SavingsAccount savings = new SavingsAccount(2000);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Withdrawing:
    int afterWithdraw = savings.balance - 300;
    savings.balance = afterWithdraw;
    System.out.println("You just withdrew "+300);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Deposit:
    int afterDeposit = savings.balance + 600;
    savings.balance = afterDeposit;
    System.out.println("You just deposited "+600);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Deposit:
    int afterDeposit2 = savings.balance + 600;
    savings.balance = afterDeposit2;
    System.out.println("You just deposited "+600);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
  }       
}
```

**1.** Now that we’ve learned about behavior, we can apply behavior to our `SavingsAccount` class using methods!

We’ve added the functionality for each method inside `main()` now, but you will be rebuilding each above `main()`. Note that your methods can directly access the `balance` field.

First, write a method called `checkBalance()` that prints:

```
Hello!Your balance is 
```

with the balance of the account displayed.

It should take in no parameters and return nothing.

Hint: A `checkPrice()` method for our `Store` class would have looked like:
```java
public void checkPrice(){
  System.out.println("Welcome!");
  System.out.println("The price is "+ price);
}
```

How would you do this for `checkBalance()`?

Don’t forget to call

```java
public class SavingsAccount {
  
  int balance;
  
  public SavingsAccount(int initialBalance){
    balance = initialBalance;
  }
  
  public void checkBalance() {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is " + balance);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args){
    SavingsAccount savings = new SavingsAccount(2000);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Withdrawing:
    int afterWithdraw = savings.balance - 300;
    savings.balance = afterWithdraw;
    System.out.println("You just withdrew "+300);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Deposit:
    int afterDeposit = savings.balance + 600;
    savings.balance = afterDeposit;
    System.out.println("You just deposited "+600);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Deposit:
    int afterDeposit2 = savings.balance + 600;
    savings.balance = afterDeposit2;
    System.out.println("You just deposited "+600);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
  }       
}
```

**2.** Now, write a method called `deposit()` that takes in an `int` parameter `amountToDeposit` and adds it to the balance. It should return nothing.

If you want, you can also have the method print:

```
You just deposited amountToDeposit
```

with the value of `amountToDeposit` displayed.

Hint: An `addInventory()` method for our `Store` class would have looked something like:
```java
public void addInventory(int inventoryToAdd){
  int newInventory = inventory + inventoryToAdd;
  inventory = newInventory;
}
```

You can do something similar for `deposit()`!

```java
public class SavingsAccount {
  
  int balance;
  
  public SavingsAccount(int initialBalance){
    balance = initialBalance;
  }
  
  public void checkBalance() {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is " + balance);
  }

  public void deposit(int amountToDeposit){
    int newBalance = balance + amountToDeposit;
    balance = newBalance;
    System.out.println("You just deposited " + amountToDeposit);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args){
    SavingsAccount savings = new SavingsAccount(2000);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Withdrawing:
    int afterWithdraw = savings.balance - 300;
    savings.balance = afterWithdraw;
    System.out.println("You just withdrew "+300);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Deposit:
    int afterDeposit = savings.balance + 600;
    savings.balance = afterDeposit;
    System.out.println("You just deposited "+600);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Deposit:
    int afterDeposit2 = savings.balance + 600;
    savings.balance = afterDeposit2;
    System.out.println("You just deposited "+600);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
  }       
}
```

**3.** Now, write a method called `withdraw()` that takes in an `int` parameter `amountToWithdraw` and subtracts it from the balance. It should return the `amountToWithdraw`.

If you want, you can also have the method print:

```
You just withdrew amountToWithdraw
```

with the value of `amountToWithdraw` displayed.

Hint: A `sellItems()` method for our `Store` class would have looked something like:
```java
public int addInventory(int numItems){
  int newInventory = sellItems - numItems;
  inventory = newInventory;
  return numItems;
}
```

You can do something similar for `withdraw()`!

```java
public class SavingsAccount {
  
  int balance;
  
  public SavingsAccount(int initialBalance){
    balance = initialBalance;
  }
  
  public void checkBalance() {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is " + balance);
  }

  public void deposit(int amountToDeposit){
    int newBalance = balance + amountToDeposit;
    balance = newBalance;
    System.out.println("You just deposited " + amountToDeposit);
  }

  public int withdraw(int amountToWithdraw) {
    int newBalance = balance - amountToWithdraw;
    balance = newBalance;
    System.out.println("You just withdrew " + amountToWithdraw);
    return amountToWithdraw;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args){
    SavingsAccount savings = new SavingsAccount(2000);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Withdrawing:
    int afterWithdraw = savings.balance - 300;
    savings.balance = afterWithdraw;
    System.out.println("You just withdrew "+300);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Deposit:
    int afterDeposit = savings.balance + 600;
    savings.balance = afterDeposit;
    System.out.println("You just deposited "+600);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Deposit:
    int afterDeposit2 = savings.balance + 600;
    savings.balance = afterDeposit2;
    System.out.println("You just deposited "+600);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
  }       
}
```

**4.** Test out your methods by trying to replace some of the code in the `main()` method with the equivalent methods!

Make sure to use `checkBalance()`, `deposit()`, and `withdraw()` at least once each.

```java
public class SavingsAccount {
  
  int balance;
  
  public SavingsAccount(int initialBalance){
    balance = initialBalance;
  }
  
  public void checkBalance() {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is " + balance);
  }

  public void deposit(int amountToDeposit){
    int newBalance = balance + amountToDeposit;
    balance = newBalance;
    System.out.println("You just deposited " + amountToDeposit);
  }

  public int withdraw(int amountToWithdraw) {
    int newBalance = balance - amountToWithdraw;
    balance = newBalance;
    System.out.println("You just withdrew " + amountToWithdraw);
    return amountToWithdraw;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args){
    SavingsAccount savings = new SavingsAccount(2000);
    
    //Check balance:
    savings.checkBalance();
    
    //Withdrawing:
    savings.withdraw(300);
    
    //Check balance:
    savings.checkBalance();
    
    //Deposit:
    savings.deposit(600);
    
    //Check balance:
    savings.checkBalance();
    
    //Deposit:
    savings.deposit(600);
    
    //Check balance:
    savings.checkBalance();
    
  }       
}
```

**5.** Congratulations! You’ve made a basic SavingsAccount.

If you want, you can add more functionality to this! What other instance fields might you want to keep track of? What might a `toString()` look like for this class?

```java
public class SavingsAccount {
  
  int balance;
  
  public SavingsAccount(int initialBalance){
    balance = initialBalance;
  }
  
  public void checkBalance() {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is " + balance);
  }

  public void deposit(int amountToDeposit){
    int newBalance = balance + amountToDeposit;
    balance = newBalance;
    System.out.println("You just deposited " + amountToDeposit);
  }

  public int withdraw(int amountToWithdraw) {
    int newBalance = balance - amountToWithdraw;
    balance = newBalance;
    System.out.println("You just withdrew " + amountToWithdraw);
    return amountToWithdraw;
  }

  public String toString(){
    return "This is a savings account with " + balance + " saved.";
  }

  public static void main(String[] args){
    SavingsAccount savings = new SavingsAccount(2000);
    
    //Check balance:
    savings.checkBalance();
    
    //Withdrawing:
    savings.withdraw(300);
    
    //Check balance:
    savings.checkBalance();
    
    //Deposit:
    savings.deposit(600);
    
    //Check balance:
    savings.checkBalance();
    
    //Deposit:
    savings.deposit(600);
    
    //Check balance:
    savings.checkBalance();
    
  }       
}
```
