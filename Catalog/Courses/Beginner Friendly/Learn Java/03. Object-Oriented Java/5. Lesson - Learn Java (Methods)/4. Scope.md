Learn Java: Methods
# Scope

A method is a task that an object of a class performs.

We mark the domain of this task using curly braces: `{`, and `}`. Everything inside the curly braces is part of the task. This domain is called the _scope_ of a method.

We can’t access variables that are declared inside a method in code that is outside the scope of that method.

Looking at the `Car` class again:

```java
class Car {
  String color;
  int milesDriven;
 
  public Car(String carColor) {
    color = carColor;
    milesDriven = 0;         
  }
 
  public void drive() {
     String message = "Miles driven: " + milesDriven;
     System.out.println(message);
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args){
     Car myFastCar = new Car("red");
     myFastCar.drive();
  }
}
```

The variable `message`, which is declared and initialized inside of `drive`, cannot be used inside of `main()`! It only exists within the _scope_ of the `drive()` method.

However, `milesDriven`, which is declared at the top of the class, can be used inside all methods in the class, since it is in the scope of the whole class.

Exercise:

```java
public class Store {
  // instance fields
  String productType;
  
  // constructor method
  public Store(String product) {
    productType = product;
  }
  
  // advertise method
  public void advertise() {
    String message = "Selling " + productType + "!";
		System.out.println(message);
  }
  
  // main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String cookie = "Cookies";
    Store cookieShop = new Store(cookie);
    
    cookieShop.advertise();
  }
}
```

**1.** Inside of the `advertise()` method, change the `productType` variable to the `cookie` variable, which is declared in the `main()` method. This should also result in the printout:

```
Selling cookies!
```

Right?

Hint: Your `advertise()` method should now look like:
```java
public void advertise() {
  String message = "Selling " + cookie + "!";
  System.out.println(message);
}
```

However, you’ll see that this code won’t work, since `cookie` is not defined in the `advertise()` method. That’s okay! It’s helpful to see the error, so that you can better understand how it looks when you call a variable outside of its scope.

```java
public class Store {
  // instance fields
  String productType;
  
  // constructor method
  public Store(String product) {
    productType = product;
  }
  
  // advertise method
  public void advertise() {
    String message = "Selling " + cookie + "!";
		System.out.println(message);
  }
  
  // main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String cookie = "Cookies";
    Store cookieShop = new Store(cookie);
    
    cookieShop.advertise();
  }
}
```

**2.** No! We got an error! The `cookie` variable cannot be accessed inside of the advertise method. The scope is wrong! Change it back to `productType`:

```java
String message = "Selling " + productType + "!";
```

Hint: Your `advertise()` method should now look like it did at first:
```java
public void advertise() {
  String message = "Selling " + productType + "!";
  System.out.println(message);
}
```

```java
public class Store {
  // instance fields
  String productType;
  
  // constructor method
  public Store(String product) {
    productType = product;
  }
  
  // advertise method
  public void advertise() {
    String message = "Selling " + productType + "!";
		System.out.println(message);
  }
  
  // main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String cookie = "Cookies";
    Store cookieShop = new Store(cookie);
    
    cookieShop.advertise();
  }
}
```

**3.** Inside of the `main()` method, print the String `message`, which is declared in the `advertise()` method. This should print:

```
Selling Cookies!
```

Right?

Hint: Your `main()` method should now look something like:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  String cookie = "Cookies";
  Store cookieShop = new Store(cookie);
 
  cookieShop.advertise();
  System.out.println(message);
}
```

However, you’ll see that this code won’t work, since `message` is not defined in the `main()` method. That’s okay! It’s helpful to see the error, so that you can better understand how it looks when you call a variable outside of its scope.

```java
public class Store {
  // instance fields
  String productType;
  
  // constructor method
  public Store(String product) {
    productType = product;
  }
  
  // advertise method
  public void advertise() {
    String message = "Selling " + productType + "!";
		System.out.println(message);
  }
  
  // main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String cookie = "Cookies";
    Store cookieShop = new Store(cookie);
    
    cookieShop.advertise();
    System.out.println(message);
  }
}
```

**4.** Foiled again! The `message` variable only exists inside the scope of the `advertise()` method!

Delete the faulty print statement from the `main()` method.

Hint: Your `main()` method should now look like it did on at first:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  String cookie = "Cookies";
  Store cookieShop = new Store(cookie);
 
  cookieShop.advertise();
}
```

```java
public class Store {
  // instance fields
  String productType;
  
  // constructor method
  public Store(String product) {
    productType = product;
  }
  
  // advertise method
  public void advertise() {
    String message = "Selling " + productType + "!";
		System.out.println(message);
  }
  
  // main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String cookie = "Cookies";
    Store cookieShop = new Store(cookie);
    
    cookieShop.advertise();
  }
}
```
