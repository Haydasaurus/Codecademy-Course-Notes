### Declaring a Method

```java
// Here is a public method named sum whose return type is int and has two int parameters a and b
public int sum(int a, int b) {
  return(a + b);
}
```

Method declarations should define the following method information: scope (private or public), return type, method name, and any parameters it receives.
