Survey of Computer Science - The Tale of Kenny
# Optimization

Being a line cook was a lot harder than Kenny thought! He wanted to find some more relaxing work so Kenny went and got a job at the small rare bookstore in town. Kenny finds that most of his time working at the bookstore is spent searching for rare books that customers request.

Sadly, the store isn’t separated into sections or labeled well, so Kenny finds himself going through row after row of books without any real direction. After a couple times of trying to look through every book from start to finish to find the one he needs, Kenny knows he needs to think of a better method, to optimize his search.

The good news is that the books are in alphabetical order, so Kenny thinks back to when he had to optimize searches when he was studying computer science and comes up with an idea. First, he’ll start on a middle shelf and check the name of the author there. If that author comes later in the alphabet than the one he’s looking for, he knows he only has to check the shelves on the left. If it comes before the author he’s looking for he only has to check the shelves on the right.

He can then repeat this method on whichever side of the store the book must be on and slowly narrow down the area where the book must be. After repeating this process a couple times he is able to pinpoint the book and find it for the customer. Kenny knows that what he ended up implementing was a _binary search_, in computer science terms, and it ended up being able to effectively optimize his search time and reduce the amount of shelf scanning he had to do by several fold.

Once again, his background in computer science is paying off!

Execise:

```Python
# This binary search function will look for a book on a bookshelf by iteratively narrowing down the area where it might find the book, until it finds the book.
def binary_search(lst, search_val):
  if len(lst) == 0:
    print("Book is not on the shelf!")
    return
  print("Checking the bookshelf and finding: {0}".format(lst[0]))
  mid = len(lst) // 2
  if lst[mid] == search_val:
    print("\nFound the book: {0}\n\n\n\n\n\n".format(search_val))
    return
  elif lst[mid] > search_val:
    binary_search(lst[:mid], search_val)
  else:
    binary_search(lst[(mid + 1):], search_val)

# This linear search looks through a bookshelf book by book until it finds the book it is looking for.    
def linear_search(lst, search_val):
  count = 0
  while len(lst) != 0:
    print("Checking the bookshelf and finding: {0}".format(lst[0]))
    if lst[0] == search_val:
    	print("\nFound the book: {0}\n\n\n\n\n\n".format(search_val))
    	return
    lst = lst[1:]
    count += 1
with open("books.csv") as f:
  books = f.read()
  bookshelf = sorted(books.split(","))
  
# Copy-paste the search code below:
```

**1.** In the code editor, you’ll see two functions. `linear_search()` shows how Kenny was initially searching through the books in the store, while `binary_search()` shows the more efficient way Kenny developed to look for books.

Let’s try to find _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ by searching through the bookshelves using a linear search. Scroll to the bottom of the code editor and copy paste the code below to run the search:

```Python
linear_search(bookshelf, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?")
```

How many books did we have to check before we found _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_? You might need to scroll the output up to see all of the books!

```Python
# This binary search function will look for a book on a bookshelf by iteratively narrowing down the area where it might find the book, until it finds the book.
def binary_search(lst, search_val):
  if len(lst) == 0:
    print("Book is not on the shelf!")
    return
  print("Checking the bookshelf and finding: {0}".format(lst[0]))
  mid = len(lst) // 2
  if lst[mid] == search_val:
    print("\nFound the book: {0}\n\n\n\n\n\n".format(search_val))
    return
  elif lst[mid] > search_val:
    binary_search(lst[:mid], search_val)
  else:
    binary_search(lst[(mid + 1):], search_val)

# This linear search looks through a bookshelf book by book until it finds the book it is looking for.    
def linear_search(lst, search_val):
  count = 0
  while len(lst) != 0:
    print("Checking the bookshelf and finding: {0}".format(lst[0]))
    if lst[0] == search_val:
    	print("\nFound the book: {0}\n\n\n\n\n\n".format(search_val))
    	return
    lst = lst[1:]
    count += 1
with open("books.csv") as f:
  books = f.read()
  bookshelf = sorted(books.split(","))
  
# Copy-paste the search code below:
linear_search(bookshelf, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?")
```

**2.** Next, let’s try to find _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ using a Kenny’s optimized method, a binary search.

Copy paste the code below into the bottom of the code editor to run the search.

```
binary_search(bookshelf, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?")
```

How many books did we have to check before we found _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ this time?

Did Kenny’s new method of searching save time?

```Python
# This binary search function will look for a book on a bookshelf by iteratively narrowing down the area where it might find the book, until it finds the book.
def binary_search(lst, search_val):
  if len(lst) == 0:
    print("Book is not on the shelf!")
    return
  print("Checking the bookshelf and finding: {0}".format(lst[0]))
  mid = len(lst) // 2
  if lst[mid] == search_val:
    print("\nFound the book: {0}\n\n\n\n\n\n".format(search_val))
    return
  elif lst[mid] > search_val:
    binary_search(lst[:mid], search_val)
  else:
    binary_search(lst[(mid + 1):], search_val)

# This linear search looks through a bookshelf book by book until it finds the book it is looking for.    
def linear_search(lst, search_val):
  count = 0
  while len(lst) != 0:
    print("Checking the bookshelf and finding: {0}".format(lst[0]))
    if lst[0] == search_val:
    	print("\nFound the book: {0}\n\n\n\n\n\n".format(search_val))
    	return
    lst = lst[1:]
    count += 1
with open("books.csv") as f:
  books = f.read()
  bookshelf = sorted(books.split(","))
  
# Copy-paste the search code below:
linear_search(bookshelf, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?")
binary_search(bookshelf, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?")
