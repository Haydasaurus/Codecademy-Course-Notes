History of Computer Science
# What Now?

The role of programming and computers has evolved over time, from the simple abacus to the complex laptops and supercomputers of today.

Today, computer science is one of the fastest growing college degrees, and half of the top-earning jobs in the United States—those pulling in $57,000 per year or higher—require the ability to code. On the Codecademy platform, you will have the ability to learn these programming skills to score a great job.

In the next lesson, we will explore how programming exactly works, for in the words of Bill Gates, “programming teaches you how to think”.
