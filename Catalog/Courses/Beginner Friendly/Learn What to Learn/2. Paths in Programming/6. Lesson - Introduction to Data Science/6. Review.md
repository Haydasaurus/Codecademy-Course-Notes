Introduction to Data Science
# Review

Review! You now know the basic parts that make up the field of data science.

-   **Data Science**—the field of taking data and transforming it into meaningful information that can help us make decisions
-   **Descriptive Statistics**—statistics that describe the data in objective terms
-   **Inferential Statistics**—inferences for the overall population based on data
-   **Probability**—the likelihood that an event will happen
-   **Programming**—the act of giving the computer instructions to perform a task
-   **Domain Expertise**—the particular set of knowledge that someone cultivates and brings with them in order to understand their data

Data science is in every field. Take a look at these cool [data science projects](http://flowingdata.com/2017/12/28/10-best-data-visualization-projects-of-2017/) that range from politics to space travel.

In our next lesson, we will go over how the different aspects of data science make up the _data science process_. These building blocks will give you an overview of how exactly data science practitioners collect and use data.
