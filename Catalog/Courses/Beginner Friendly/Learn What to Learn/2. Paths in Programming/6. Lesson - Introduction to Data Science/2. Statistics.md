# Statistics

A fundamental part of data science is _statistics_.

Some people say that data science is statistics dressed up for the 21st century - and thereâ€™s some truth in that. Statistics has been practiced for centuries but with the advent of computing prowess in the middle of the 20th century, statistics has taken on a new form.

As a refresher, statistics is the practice of applying mathematical calculations to sets of data to derive meaning. Statistics can give us a quick summary of a dataset, such as the average amount or how consistent a dataset is.

There are two types of statistics: _descriptive statistics_ and _inferential statistics_. Descriptive statistics describe a dataset using mathematically calculated values, such as the mean and standard deviation. For instance, the graph below from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-the-gender-pay-gap-looks-like-by-income-level/) charts the wage gap between American men and women in 2014. An example of a descriptive statistic would be that at the 90th income percentile, women make 80.6% of what men make on average.

These values are useful when summarizing data collections.

On the other hand, inferential statistics are statistical calculations that enable us to draw conclusions about the larger population. For instance, from looking at the graph we can infer that at the 99th income percentile, women make less than 78% of what men make on average. We can also infer that the reason why the wage gap is smallest at the 10th income percentile is because the minimum wage for men and women is the same.
