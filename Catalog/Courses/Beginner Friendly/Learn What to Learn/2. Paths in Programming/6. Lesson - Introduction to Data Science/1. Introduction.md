Introduction to Data Science
# Introduction

Our world contains massive amounts of data. In fact, more data exists in the world from the last ten years than in the last two thousand. But what does that mean and why should we care?

Data is the building blocks for information. And information can carry meaning - from a click telling us what someone likes, to toxins in the water signaling a health concern. But data (as a collection of records) is meaningless unless we _do_ something with it. That’s where data science comes in.

_Data science_ enables us to take data and transform it into meaningful information that can help us make decisions. Data science is interdisciplinary and combines other well-known fields such as probability, statistics, analytics, and computer science. The work that you might do could range from writing up reports to building machine learning models. No matter what your interests are, data science is applicable - because these days, we have data on everything!

In this lesson, we’ll introduce you to building blocks of data science so you can get a sense of the different skills you will need to pursue a career in the field.
