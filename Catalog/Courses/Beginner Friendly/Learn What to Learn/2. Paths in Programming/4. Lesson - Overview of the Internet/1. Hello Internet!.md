Overview of the Internet
# Hello, Internet!

It is nearly impossible to overstate how much the internet has changed how we consume information and communicate with one another. More than four billion people around the world are internet users and the total number of websites on the world wide web is nearing two billion.

Despite the presence of the internet in our lives, very few internet users understand how it works. You don’t need to be an engineer to benefit from understanding how the internet works. However, understanding the internet’s infrastructure will help you decide if learning web development is right for you.

In this lesson, you will learn how the internet works behind the scenes. After finishing this lesson, you’ll be able to answer questions like:

-   How is data sent from one computer to another?
-   What is the relationship between a browser and a server?
-   How is code turned into the experience that users see in their browsers?
-   How has the web and web development changed from its invention to today?

By the end of this lesson, you will have the knowledge that you need to collaborate more effectively with engineers and jump into your own career in web development.
