Overview of the Internet
# Current Internet Trends

The rise of internet-connected smartphones has profoundly changed how users interact with the internet. Mobile internet traffic now accounts for more than half of all internet traffic and web development practices have evolved in order to provide a good user experience regardless of device type.

#### Responsive Web Design

The rise of _responsive web design_ has changed how websites are built. Responsive web design was enabled by additions to the CSS language, like media queries and relative units. These additions allow the presentation of websites to adjust based on the size of the window in which they are displayed.

#### Mobile Applications and Devices

The rise of internet-connected _mobile applications_ has changed the way that we think about browsing the internet. Users accessing the internet on smartphones are likely to spend much more time with specific applications, rather than using their phone’s browser.

Though most mobile applications are internet connected, they are not part of the world wide web. The web is built out of links, whereas mobile applications are designed to keep the user’s attention.

If you want to learn about mobile development, web development is a great place to start! While the majority of mobile applications are built in programming languages, like Swift for iOS, it is increasingly common to see developers using JavaScript frameworks to build new apps.
