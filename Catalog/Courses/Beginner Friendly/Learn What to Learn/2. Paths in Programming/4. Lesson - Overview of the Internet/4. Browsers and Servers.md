Overview of the Internet
# Browsers and Servers

As we’ve seen, the internet is a network that links computer devices worldwide, enabling people to share information with one another despite vast distances. But how is information sent from one device to another?

One way of understanding this process is to look at the _client-server_ model. In this model, the _client_ refers to the user’s device or program that is making a request for data. A client can be a browser or application running on a user’s laptop, smartphone, or tablet.

The _server_ is the device or program in that network that waits for incoming requests and sends back data. This might be an in-house server, a rented server at a data center, or cloud server. At Codecademy, we have servers that store lesson data and our servers are sending this lesson data to your client device.
