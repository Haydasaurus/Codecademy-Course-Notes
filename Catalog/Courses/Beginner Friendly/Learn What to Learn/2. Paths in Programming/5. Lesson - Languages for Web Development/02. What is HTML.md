# What is HTML

Alejandra knows that the first step to building a website is learning HTML. Why? _HTML_ is the skeleton of all web pages. It provides structure to the content on a website, including text, images, buttons, videos, and more.

HTML is a practical place to start learning to code. You can build basic websites after learning just a little HTML, with text, images, and videos. You can always open up your work-in-progress website with your browser and see what you’re building.

HTML stands for **h**ypertext **m**arkup **l**anguage. In the next few exercises, we will look at the HTML acronym word-by-word to unpack what HTML really means.

Take a peek at the HTML code to the right. Some parts of the language are pretty intuitive, see if you can figure out how anything works.

If not, don’t worry! We’ll explain it soon.
