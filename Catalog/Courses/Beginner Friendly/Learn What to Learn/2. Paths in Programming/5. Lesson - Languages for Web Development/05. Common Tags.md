# Common Tags

Okay, let’s practice using HTML elements by writing a few different tags.

Here are a few common tags that you can start getting familiar with:

```HTML
<h1>This is a heading, it emphasizes text.</h1>
 
<p>This is a paragraph, it is the most common tag for larger chunks of text.</p>
 
<a>This is an anchor tag, used to specify the text that is the "anchor" for a link.</a>
 
<button>This is a button.</button>
```

Hint: Don’t forget the closing tag!
