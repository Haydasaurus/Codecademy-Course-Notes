# Adding Hyperlinks

Let’s explore how hypertext works by adding a link to a basic website!

Reading and modifying code is an essential first step in learning to build things for the web. This practice can take you a long way while you’re learning to build websites from scratch.

An _attribute_ in HTML provides additional information about an HTML element. It comes in a name and value pair with the structure `name="value"`. For example, you can specify the width of an HTML element with the attribute `width="500"`.

Links are created in HTML with something called the `href` attribute, which stands for **h**yperlink **ref**erence. The `href` attribute allows us to specify the URL, or address on the web, that a link should take users to. See below for an example of the `href` attribute in action.

When we set the `href` property on an anchor tag (abbreviated to `<a>`) we can specify both the text that should be rendered for the user (the text within the anchor tag) and the URL that the browser should navigate to.

With this code, we’re assigning the value `www.codecademy.com` to the `href` attribute. When a user clicks on the text of this link (Learn to code!), they will be directed to [www.codecademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com).

```HTML
<a href="www.codecademy.com">Learn to code!</a>
```

**1.** Alejandra has begun to build out her business’s website. She wants to link from her homepage to a different page that contains her resume.

To start, look in **index.html** for the text that says `25 years of experience` — it should be near line 20. Put an anchor tag (`<a>`) around this text.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Jetsetter Concierge Travel Planning</title>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300,400,600,700|Quicksand:300,700" rel="stylesheet">

  </head>
<body>
    <div class="overlay">
        <div class="header">
            <div id="header-text">
                <h1>Jetsetter Concierge</h1>
                <h2>Whether you're looking for adventure or luxury, let us help you plan your perfect getaway.</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="partner">
            <h4>Proud Partner of Am South Airlines <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/programs/code-foundations-path/amsoair.png" id="aa-logo" width="150px"></h4>
    </div>
    <div class="main">
        <h3>Why You Should Choose Jetsetter Concierge Travel Planning</h3>
      <p><a>With over 25 years of experience in concierge, high-end travel planning, we'll provide you with the highest quality services. Every vacation is unique, custom, and tailored to your tastes.</a></p>

        <div class="value-props">

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>

```

**2.** Add a `href` attribute to this anchor tag, and give it the value `/resume.html`.

This URL is called a _relative path_ and it looks a little different from the full URLs you’re used to seeing. That’s because it’s actually a link to another page on the same website, so we can omit the first part. Instead of `www.jetsetter.com/resume.html` we can abbreviate the link to just `/resume.html`.

Hint: An attribute provides more data to the HTML element, and it is represented as a key-value pair within the elements opening tag.

For example:
```html
<img src="img_chair.jpg" alt="Oak desk chair">
```

The `src` attribute here specifies the path to the image, and the `alt` attribute provides a text description of the image.

The `href` attribute is used to specify the path of a hyperlink.

```html
<a href="/book/5">More information</a> about this book is available from the publisher.
