Welcome to Codecademy!
# Write some code!

The code in the editor panel is written in a programming language known as JavaScript, but that detail isn’t too important right now—it’s time to start writing your own code!

When you run your code in this exercise, we’ll run some tests to make sure that you’ve added or changed the code correctly. If something’s not right, you’ll see an error message at the bottom of the code editor. If everything is good, you’ll be able to move on!

Exercise: 

```JS
// Change the text between the quotation marks and run your code to see your name animated!
drawName('Enter your name here');

// The code below will allow you to interact with the letters
bounceBubbles();
```

**1.** Change the text between the single quotation marks (`''`) to your name and click the ‘Run’ button.

```JS
// Change the text between the quotation marks and run your code to see your name animated!
drawName('Hayden');

// The code below will allow you to interact with the letters
bounceBubbles();
