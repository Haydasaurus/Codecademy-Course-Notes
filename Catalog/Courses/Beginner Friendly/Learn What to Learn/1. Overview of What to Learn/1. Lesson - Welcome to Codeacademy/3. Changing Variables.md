# Changing Variables

Now you’ll use a _variable_ to quickly change your program. Variables are used to store some kind of data in a program that can be referenced elsewhere (often more than once).

Variables look different in different programming languages. In the code editor, there’s a line that looks like this:

```JS
message = 'Change the message!';
```

This line creates a `message` variable and stores the `Change the message!` text in it.

Later in the program, `message` is used to reference that text inside `drawName()`, meaning that the `message` text appears on the screen.

---

Exercise:

```JS
// Change the value of the message variable to change the text on screen
message = 'Change the message!';

drawName(message);
bounceBubbles();
```

**1.** Change the text stored in the single quotes (`''`) stored in the `message` variable from `'Change the message!'` to a new message.

```JS
// Change the value of the message variable to change the text on screen
message = 'Hello there';

drawName(message);
bounceBubbles();
```
