# Change Physics!

Part of the power of coding is that small changes can create big impacts. Now that you’ve experimented with changing the color and text, it’s time to experiment with the animation itself!

---

Exercise:

```JS
// Define color variables:
red = [0, 100, 63];
orange = [40, 100, 60];
green = [75, 100, 40];
blue = [196, 77, 55];
purple = [280, 50, 60];
letterColors = [red, orange, green, blue, purple];

// This variable controls the smallest distance at which a mouse will make the dots react
mouseResponseThreshold = 50;

// This variable controls how strongly the dots will try to return to their starting position
friction = 0.85;

// This variable controls how much the dots will rotate when interacting
rotationForce = 0.0;

message = 'Change the physics!';

drawName(message, letterColors);
bounceBubbles();
```

**1.** Three variables let you experiment with the animation physics: `mouseResponseThreshold`, `friction`, and `rotationForce`.

`mouseResponseThreshold` affects how close the mouse pointer needs to be to affect the dots that make up the letters. The larger the number, the more powerful the effect of the mouse interaction. Experiment with changing the `mouseResponseThreshold` to different numbers and running your code!

Hint: Try starting out by setting the threshold to 150.
```JS
mouseResponseThreshold = 150;
```

```JS
// Define color variables:
red = [0, 100, 63];
orange = [40, 100, 60];
green = [75, 100, 40];
blue = [196, 77, 55];
purple = [280, 50, 60];
letterColors = [red, orange, green, blue, purple];

// This variable controls the smallest distance at which a mouse will make the dots react
mouseResponseThreshold = 150;

// This variable controls how strongly the dots will try to return to their starting position
friction = 0.85;

// This variable controls how much the dots will rotate when interacting
rotationForce = 0.0;

message = 'Change the physics!';

drawName(message, letterColors);
bounceBubbles();
```

**2.** Try experimenting with the `friction` value! You’ll probably want to keep `friction` between `0` and `1`.

Hint: Try setting a higher `friction` number like `0.95`. What happens to the animation interaction?

```JS
// Define color variables:
red = [0, 100, 63];
orange = [40, 100, 60];
green = [75, 100, 40];
blue = [196, 77, 55];
purple = [280, 50, 60];
letterColors = [red, orange, green, blue, purple];

// This variable controls the smallest distance at which a mouse will make the dots react
mouseResponseThreshold = 150;

// This variable controls how strongly the dots will try to return to their starting position
friction = 0.95;

// This variable controls how much the dots will rotate when interacting
rotationForce = 0.0;

message = 'Change the physics!';

drawName(message, letterColors);
bounceBubbles();
```

**3.** Finally, try experimenting with the `rotationForce` value. This variable represents how much each animated dot will try to rotate when interacting with the mouse. Try keeping this value small, maybe around `0.01`.

```JS
// Define color variables:
red = [0, 100, 63];
orange = [40, 100, 60];
green = [75, 100, 40];
blue = [196, 77, 55];
purple = [280, 50, 60];
letterColors = [red, orange, green, blue, purple];

// This variable controls the smallest distance at which a mouse will make the dots react
mouseResponseThreshold = 150;

// This variable controls how strongly the dots will try to return to their starting position
friction = 0.95;

// This variable controls how much the dots will rotate when interacting
rotationForce = 0.01;

message = 'Change the physics!';

drawName(message, letterColors);
bounceBubbles();
```
