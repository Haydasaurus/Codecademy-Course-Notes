# Multiple Colors

The text is now displayed in multiple colors! There is a new variable named `letterColors` with a list of color variables inside brackets (`[]`)separated by commas (`,`).

```JS
letterColors = [red, orange, green, blue, purple];
```

The displayed text in the browser panel will cycle through the values in `letterColors` in order when `drawName()` is called with `letterColors`.

Learning to code is all about experimentation—trying out new code and observing the result! As you experiment, you may want to reset your code to the starting state. This can be done with the reset button at the bottom of your code editor:

Exercise:

```JS
// Color variables:
red = [0, 100, 63];
orange = [40, 100, 60];
green = [75, 100, 40];
blue = [196, 77, 55];
purple = [280, 50, 60];

// Letters in the message will cycle through these colors:
letterColors = [red, orange, green, blue, purple];

message = 'Multiple colors!';

drawName(message, letterColors);
bounceBubbles();
```

**1.** Each color is represented by three numbers between `[]`. Try changing numbers, running your code, and observing the result. You can always reset your code if you don’t like the result.

Hint: Try experimenting with the first number in the list between brackets. For instance, to turn `red` into a greenish color, change the first number to `130`:
```JS
red = [130, 100, 63]
```

```JS
// Color variables:
red = [24, 70, 69];
orange = [93, 22, 68];
green = [38, 93, 16];
blue = [94, 23, 72];
purple = [70, 10, 100];

// Letters in the message will cycle through these colors:
letterColors = [red, orange, green, blue, purple];

message = 'Multiple colors!';

drawName(message, letterColors);
bounceBubbles();
```
