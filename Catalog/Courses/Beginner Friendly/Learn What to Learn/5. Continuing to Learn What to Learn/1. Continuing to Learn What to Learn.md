# Continuing to Learn What to Learn

In this closing article, we’ll help guide you towards the course that is best suited for you.

Phew! You’ve just seen a ton of examples, stories, opinions, and recommendations on how to get started with programming. If you’re still feeling stuck on where to begin, we thought it would be helpful to see a couple of our recommendations.

Our [Sorting Quiz](https://www.codecademy.com/explore/sorting-quiz) is a fun way to narrow in on what aspects of programming you might like. Find out if you’re a problem solver, user advocate, question asker, or dot connector. Our quiz will recommend courses to you based on your personality type!

If you want more high-level explanations of Computer Science, Web Development, and Data Science, our [Code Foundations](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/code-foundations) path will teach you the basics of programming while giving you more details about those three domains.

Finally, if you know what you want to do, but aren’t sure which specific course is right for you, check out our Skill Paths and Career paths on our [full catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/all). These paths are _big_ and take out the guesswork on what to study next. Our most comprehensive paths are the [Full Stack Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path), [Data Scientist Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science), and [Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science).

Finally, one of the challenges of learning online is the sense of isolation. It’s easy to feel like you’re alone in your learning journey. The Codecademy community is a great resource to use when you start feeling those pains. Our [forums](https://discuss.codecademy.com/) are a great place to seek advice, discuss your code, and find inspiration.

Good luck taking your first steps on your programming journey!
