# How to File your Income Taxes

Filing for taxes is required by federal and state law in most countries. We will focus on the income tax process in the United States. This process will vary in implementation if you are “self-employed” vs if you are someone who has an employer. If you were a paid employee, your employee will give you a special form.

If this is your first time filing your taxes, here is some terminology that might sound intimidating when you first hear them:

-   _W-2_ Forms from all employers you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) worked for during the past tax year. Your employer will usually mail this to your address on file or give you access to a digital copy online. Feel free to reach out to Human Resources at your company if you do not
-   _1099_ Forms if you (or your spouse) completed contract work and earned more than $600. The contractor will usually mail this to your address on file or give you access to a digital copy online.

The IRS provides a handy [Tax Form](https://www.irs.com/articles/tax-form-checklist). We recommend using online services such as Turbo Tax. If you are self-employed, know that you should keep track of all of your job-related expenses since this will help reduce your taxable income. This process is a bit more involved so it might require help from an accountant your first time around.
