Life Skills We Wish They'd Taught Us In School
# How to Remove Stains from Clothing

Another soft skill we all wish we’d learn in school is a bit more practical, getting rid of stains can be very tricky and ruin an outfit you love. Picture this: you’re about to walk out the door to go to work when you realize that you’ve spilled coffee on your shirt! What should you?

It might be tempting to throw your shirt in the washing machine, but that’s almost always the wrong decision. Washing your stained clothes could actually cause the stain to set, making it impossible to get out later.

Instead, get your laundry detergent (or dish soap, if you don’t have liquid detergent on hand). Pour a small amount of detergent or dish soap onto the stain, followed by a drop or two of water. Use your index finger or a toothbrush to rub the detergent into the stain. If the stain doesn’t come out right away, try leaving the detergent on the stain for a couple hours and then trying again.

If the above method doesn’t work, rubbing alcohol (good for pen marks) or vinegar could also help. For small blood stains, using hydrogen peroxide should do the trick.

Once the stain is no longer visible, wash your clothes as normal, and they should come out of the laundry good as new!
