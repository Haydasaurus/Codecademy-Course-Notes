### Comments

Comments are bits of text that are not executed. These lines can be used to leave notes and increase the readability of the program.

-   Single line comments are created with two forward slashes `//`.
-   Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They are useful for commenting out large blocks of code.

```
// This is a single line comment /* This is a multi-line comment   and continues until the end   of comment symbol is reached */
```
