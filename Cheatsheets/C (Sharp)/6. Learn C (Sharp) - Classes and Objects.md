### C# Classes

In C#, _classes_ are used to create custom types. The class defines the kinds of information and methods included in a custom type.

```
using System; namespace BasicClasses{    class Forest {    public string name;    public int trees;    }} // Here we have the Forest class which has two pieces of data, called fields. They are the "name" and "trees" fields.
```

### C# Constructor

In C#, whenever an instance of a class is created, its _constructor_ is called. Like methods, a constructor can be overloaded. It must have the same name as the enclosing class. This is useful when you may want to define an additional constructor that takes a different number of arguments.

```
// Takes two argumentspublic Forest(int area, string country){   this.Area = area;  this.Country = country;} // Takes one argumentpublic Forest(int area){   this.Area = area;  this.Country = "Unknown";}  // Typically, a constructor is used to set initial values and run any code needed to “set up” an instance. // A constructor looks like a method, but its return type and method name are reduced to the name of the enclosing type.
```

### C# Parameterless Constructor

In C#, if no constructors are specified in a class, the compiler automatically creates a parameterless constructor.

```
public class Freshman{  public string FirstName  { get; set; }} public static void Main (string[] args){  Freshman f = new Freshman();  // name is null  string name = f.FirstName;} // In this example, no constructor is defined in Freshman, but a parameterless constructor is still available for use in Main().
```

### C# Access Modifiers

In C#, members of a class can be marked with _access modifiers_, including `public` and `private`. A `public` member can be accessed by other classes. A `private` member can only be accessed by code in the same class.

By default, fields, properties, and methods are private, and classes are public.

```
public class Speech{  private string greeting = "Greetings";   private string FormalGreeting()  {    return $"{greeting} and salutations";  }   public string Scream()  {    return FormalGreeting().ToUpper();  } } public static void Main (string[] args){  Speech s = new Speech();  //string sfg = s.FormalGreeting(); // Error!  //string sg = s.greeting; // Error!  Console.WriteLine(s.Scream());} // In this example, greeting and FormalGreeting() are private. They cannot be called from the Main() method, which belongs to a different class. However the code within Scream() can access those members because Scream() is part of the same class.
```

### C# Field

In C#, a _field_ stores a piece of data within an object. It acts like a variable and may have a different value for each instance of a type.

A field can have a number of modifiers, including: `public`, `private`, `static`, and `readonly`. If no access modifier is provided, a field is `private` by default.

```
public class Person{   private string firstName;   private string lastName;} // In this example, firstName and lastName are private fields of the Person class. // For effective encapsulation, a field is typically set to private, then accessed using a property. This ensures that values passed to an instance are validated (assuming the property implements some kind of validation for its field).
```

### C# this Keyword

In C#, the `this` keyword refers to the current instance of a class.

```
// We can use the this keyword to refer to the current class’s members hidden by similar names:public NationalPark(int area, string state){  this.area = area;  this.state = state;} // The code below requires duplicate code, which can lead to extra work and errors when changes are needed:public NationalPark(int area, string state){  area = area;  state = state;}public NationalPark(int area){  area = area;  state = "Unknown";} // Use this to have one constructor call another:public NationalPark(int area) : this (state, "Unknown"){ } 
```

### C# Members

In C#, a class contains _members_, which define the kind of data stored in a class and the behaviors a class can perform.

```
class Forest{  public string name;  public string Name  {    get { return name; }    set { name = value; }  }} // A member of a class can be a field (like name), a property (like Name) or a method (like get()/set()). It can also be any of the following:// Constants// Constructors// Events// Finalizers// Indexers// Operators// Nested Types
```

### C# Dot Notation

In C#, a member of a class can be accessed with dot notation.

```
string greeting = "hello"; // Prints 5Console.WriteLine(greeting.Length); // Returns 8Math.Min(8, 920);
```

### C# Class Instance

In C#, an object is an _instance_ of a class. An object can be created from a class using the `new` keyword.

```
Burger cheeseburger = new Burger();// If a class is a recipe, then an object is a single meal made from that recipe. House tudor = new House();// If a class is a blueprint, then an object is a house made from that blueprint. 
```

### C# Property

In C#, a _property_ is a member of an object that controls how one field may be accessed and/or modified. A property defines two methods: a `get()` method that describes how a field can be accessed, and a `set()` method that describes how a field can be modified.

One use case for properties is to control access to a field. Another is to validate values for a field.

```
public class Freshman{  private string firstName;   public string FirstName  {    get { return firstName; }    set { firstName = value; }  }} public static void Main (string[] args) {  Freshman f = new Freshman();  f.FirstName = "Louie";    // Prints "Louie"  Console.WriteLine(f.FirstName);} // In this example, FirstName is a property 
```

### C# Auto-Implemented Property

In C#, an _auto-implemented_ property reads and writes to a private field, like other properties, but it does not require explicit definitions for the accessor methods nor the field. It is used with the `{ get; set; }` syntax. This helps your code become more concise.

```
public class HotSauce{  public string Title  { get; set; }   public string Origin  { get; set; }} // In this example, Title and Origin are auto-implemented properties. Notice that a definition for each field (like private string title) is no longer necessary. A hidden, private field is created for each property during runtime.
```

### C# Static Constructor

In C#, a _static constructor_ is run once per type, not per instance. It must be parameterless. It is invoked before the type is instantiated or a static member is accessed.

```
class Forest{  static Forest()  {     Console.WriteLine("Type Initialized");   }}// In this class, either of the following two lines would trigger the static constructor (but it would not be triggered twice if these two lines followed each other in succession):Forest f  = new Forest();Forest.Define();
```

### C# Static Class

In C#, a _static_ class cannot be instantiated. Its members are accessed by the class name.

This is useful when you want a class that provides a set of tools, but doesn’t need to maintain any internal data.

`Math` is a commonly-used static class.

```
//Two examples of static classes calling static methods: Math.Min(23, 97);Console.WriteLine("Let's Go!");
```
