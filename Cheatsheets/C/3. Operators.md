### Mathmatical Symbols in C

C is able to perform basic mathematical operations on variables and values using the following symbols:

-   Addition: `+`
-   Subtraction: `-`
-   Division: `/`
-   Multiplication: `*`
-   Incrementing: `++`
-   Decrementing: `--`
-   Modulo: `%`

### Assignment Operations in C

C can assign values to variables and perform basic mathematical operations using shorthand operators:

-   Assignment: `=`
-   Addition then assignment: `+=`
-   Subtraction then assignment: `-=`
-   Multiplication then assignment: `*=`
-   Division then assignment: `/=`
-   Modulo then assignment: `%=`

### Comparing values in C

C can compare two values and/or variables against each other to return true or false. The operators are as follows:

-   Do both sides have the same value? `==`
-   Do the two sides have different values? `!=`
-   Is the left side a lower value than the right side? `<`
-   Is the left side a lower or equal value to the right side? `<=`
-   Is the left side a greater value than the right side? `>`
-   Is the left side a greater or equal value to the right side? `>=`

### Logical Operators in C

C can perform logical operations using the following operators:

-   and: `&&` (Are both sides true?)
-   or: `||` (Is at least one side true?)
-   not: `!` (True becomes false and false becomes true.)
