### C Variable Names

In C variable names must follow specific rules:

-   Names can only be composed of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and underscores.
-   The first character must be a letter (upper or lower case).
-   No keywords are allowed as the full name (`int` is not allowed but `int_count` would work).

### Data Types in C

The main data types in C are: `int`, `float`, `double`, and `char`.

### Setting Variables in C

Variables in C can be initialized with values at their declaration or have their values set later in the code.

### Variable Casting in C

In C a variable can be cast explicitly or implicitly from one data type to another. They can then be used directly or stored in another variable.
