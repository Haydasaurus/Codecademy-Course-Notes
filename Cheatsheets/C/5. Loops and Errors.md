### Types of Loops

Loops can be written as `while` loops, `do-while` loops, and `for` loops.

### while Loops

`while` loops iterate until a condition is met.

```
while (a < 10) {  a++;}
```

### do-while Loops

`do-while` loops are `while` loops that initially execute the body once before checking the condition.

```
do {  printf("not true!");} (while 2 == 3);
```

### for Loops

`for` loops complete a set number of iterations before meeting a condition.

```
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {  printf("Hello!");}
```

### Loop Keywords

All loops can utilize keywords like `continue` and `break`. `continue` restarts the loop and `break` breaks out of (or ends) the loop.

### Rewriting Loops

A `for` loop can always be re-written as a `while` loop; most `while` loops can be re-written as a `for` loop.
