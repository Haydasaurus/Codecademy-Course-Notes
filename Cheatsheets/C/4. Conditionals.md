### Types of Conditionals

A conditional in C can be written using `if`, `else-if`, `else, ternary operators, and`switch` statements.

### if Statements

An `if` statement tests an expression and executes code based on its truth.

```
if (x == 3) {  printf("x is 3!");}
```

### else-if Statements

An `else-if` statement tests an expression and must come after an existing `if` or `else-if`.

```
if (x > 3) {  printf("x is greater than 3");} else if (x < 3) {  printf("x is less than 3");}
```

### else Statements

An `else` statement is accessed when all preceding `if` and/or `else-if` statements return `false`.

```
if (x > 3) {  printf("x is greater than 3");} else if (x < 3) {  printf("x is less than 3");} else {  printf("x equals 3");}
```

### Dangling else Statement

A dangling `else` statement results when it’s ambiguous which conditional the `else` statement is attached to.

### Ternary Operators

A ternary operator is a condensed `if-else` statement.

```
min = a < b ? a : b; // This is the same as the if-else below if (a < b) {  min = a;} else {  min = b;}
```

### switch Statements

A `switch` statement is a condensed series of cascading `else` statements. It tests a value and compares it against multiple cases.

```
switch (grade) {  case 9:    printf("Freshman\n");    break;  case 10:    printf("Sophomore\n");    break;  case 11:    printf("Junior\n");    break;  case 12:    printf("Senior\n");    break;  default:    printf("Invalid\n");    break;}
```

### Operators and Conditionals

A conditional in C can use relational operators such as `&&`, `||`, and `!` to compare values and test multiple expressions.
