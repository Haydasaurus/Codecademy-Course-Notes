### `const` Reference

In C++, pass-by-reference with `const` can be used for a function where the parameter(s) won’t change inside the function.

This saves the computational cost of making a copy of the argument.

```
int triple(int const &i) {   return i * 3; }
```

### Pointers

In C++, a _pointer_ variable stores the memory address of something else. It is created using the `*` sign.

```
int* pointer = &gum;
```

### References

In C++, a _reference_ variable is an alias for another object. It is created using the `&` sign. Two things to note:

1.  Anything done to the reference also happens to the original.
2.  Aliases cannot be changed to alias something else.

```
int &sonny = songqiao;
```

### Memory Address

In C++, the _memory address_ is the location in the memory of an object. It can be accessed with the “address of” operator, `&`.

Given a variable `porcupine_count`, the memory address can be retrieved by printing out `&porcupine_count`. It will return something like: `0x7ffd7caa5b54`.

```
std::cout << &porcupine_count << "\n";
```

### Dereference

In C++, a _dereference reference operator_, `*`, can be used to obtain the value pointed to by a pointer variable.

```
int gum = 3; // * on left side is a pointerint* pointer = &gum; // * on right side is a dereference of that pointerint dereference = *pointer;
```

### Pass-By-Reference

In C++, _pass-by-reference_ refers to passing parameters to a function by using references.

It allows the ability to:

-   Modify the value of the function arguments.
-   Avoid making copies of a variable/object for performance reasons.

```
void swap_num(int &i, int &j) {   int temp = i;  i = j;  j = temp; } int main() {   int a = 100;  int b = 200;   swap_num(a, b);   std::cout << "A is " << a << "\n";  std::cout << "B is " << b << "\n"; }
```
