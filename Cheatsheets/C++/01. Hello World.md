### New Line

The escape sequence `\n` (backward slash and the letter n) generates a new line in a text string.

```
std::cout << "Hello\n";std::cout << "Hello again\n";
```

### Program Structure

The program runs line by line, from top to bottom:

-   The first line instructs the compiler to locate the file that contains a library called `iostream`. This library contains code that allows for input and output.
-   The `main()` function houses all the instructions for the program.

```
#include <iostream> int main() {   std::cout << "1\n";  std::cout << "2\n";  std::cout << "3\n"; }
```

### Basic Output

`std::cout` is the “character output stream” and it is used to write to the standard output. It is followed by the symbols `<<` and the value to be displayed.

```
std::cout << "Hello World!\n"; 
```

### Compile Command

Using GNU, the compilation command is `g++` followed by the file name. Here, the name of the source file is **hello.cpp**.

```
g++ hello.cpp
```

### Execute Command

The execution command is `./` followed by the file name. Here, the name of the executable file is **a.out**.

```
./a.out
```

### Single-line Comments

Single-line comments are created using two consecutive forward slashes. The compiler ignores any text after `//` on the same line.

```
// This line will denote a comment in C++
```

### Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments are created using `/*` to begin the comment, and `*/` to end the comment. The compiler ignores any text in between.

```
/* This is all commented out.None of it is going to run!*/
```
