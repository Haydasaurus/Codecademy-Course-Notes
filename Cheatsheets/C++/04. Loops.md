### `while` Loop

A `while` loop statement repeatedly executes the code block within as long as the condition is `true`. The moment the condition becomes `false`, the program will exit the loop.

Note that the `while` loop might not ever run. If the condition is `false` initially, the code block will be skipped.

```
while (password != 1234) {   std::cout << "Try again: ";  std::cin >> password; }
```

### `for` Loop

A `for` loop executes a code block a specific number of times. It has three parts:

-   The initialization of a counter
-   The continue condition
-   The increment/decrement of the counter

This example prints 0 to 9 on the screen.

```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {    std::cout << i << "\n";  }
```
