### Vector Type

During the creation of a C++ vector, the data type of its elements must be specified. Once the vector is created, the type cannot be changed.

### Index

An index refers to an element’s position within an ordered list, like a vector or an array. The first element has an index of 0.

A specific element in a vector or an array can be accessed using its index, like `name[index]`.

```
std::vector<double> order = {3.99, 12.99, 2.49}; // What's the first element?std::cout << order[0]; // What's the last element?std::cout << order[2];
```

### `.size()` Function

The `.size()` function can be used to return the number of elements in a vector, like `name.size()`.

```
std::vector<std::string> employees; employees.push_back("michael");employees.push_back("jim");employees.push_back("pam");employees.push_back("dwight"); std::cout << employees.size();// Prints: 4
```

### Vectors

In C++, a vector is a dynamic list of items, that can shrink and grow in size. It is created using `std::vector<type> name;` and it can only store values of the same type.

To use vectors, it is necessary to `#include` the `vector` library.

```
#include <iostream>#include <vector> int main() {    std::vector<int> grades(3);    grades[0] = 90;  grades[1] = 86;  grades[2] = 98;  }
```

### `.push_back()` & `.pop_back()`

The following functions can be used to add and remove an element in a vector:

-   `.push_back()` to add an element to the “end” of a vector
-   `.pop_back()` to remove an element from the “end” of a vector

```
std::vector<std::string> wishlist; wishlist.push_back("Oculus");wishlist.push_back("Telecaster"); wishlist.pop_back(); std::cout << wishlist.size(); // Prints: 1
```
