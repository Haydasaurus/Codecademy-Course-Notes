### `if` Statement

An `if` statement is used to test an expression for truth.

-   If the condition evaluates to `true`, then the code within the block is executed; otherwise, it will be skipped.

```
if (a == 10) {  // Code goes here}
```

### `else` Clause

An `else` clause can be added to an `if` statement.

-   If the condition evaluates to `true`, code in the `if` part is executed.
-   If the condition evaluates to `false`, code in the `else` part is executed.

```
if (year == 1991) {  // This runs if it is true}else {  // This runs if it is false}
```

### `switch` Statement

A `switch` statement provides a means of checking an expression against various `case`s. If there is a match, the code within starts to execute. The `break` keyword can be used to terminate a case.

`default` is executed when no case matches.

```
switch (grade) {  case 9:    std::cout << "Freshman\n";    break;  case 10:    std::cout << "Sophomore\n";    break;  case 11:    std::cout << "Junior\n";    break;  case 12:    std::cout << "Senior\n";    break;  default:    std::cout << "Invalid\n";    break;}
```

### Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two values and return `true` or `false` depending on the comparison:

-   `==` equal to
    
-   `!=` not equal to
    
-   `>` greater than
    
-   `<` less than
    
-   `>=` greater than or equal to
    
-   `<=` less than or equal to
    

```
if (a > 10) {   // ☝️ means greater than}
```

### `else if` Statement

One or more `else if` statements can be added in between the `if` and `else` to provide additional condition(s) to check.

```
if (apple > 8) {  // Some code here}else if (apple > 6) {  // Some code here}else {  // Some code here}
```

### Logical Operators

Logical operators can be used to combine two different conditions.

-   `&&` requires both to be true (`and`)
-   `||` requires either to be true (`or`)
-   `!` negates the result (`not`)

```
if (coffee > 0 && donut > 1) {  // Code runs if both are true} if (coffee > 0 || donut > 1) {  // Code runs if either is true} if (!tired) {  // Code runs if tired is false}
```
