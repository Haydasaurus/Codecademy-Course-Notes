### PHP else statement

A PHP else statement can follow an `if` block. If the condition of the `if` does not evaluate to `TRUE`, the code block following `else` will be executed.

```
$condition = FALSE;if ($condition) {  // This code block will not execute} else {  // This code block will execute}
```

### PHP comparison operators

PHP _comparison operators_ are used to compare two values and return `TRUE` or `FALSE` depending on the validity of the comparison. Comparison operators include:

-   identical (`===`)
-   not identical (`!==`)
-   greater than (`>`)
-   less than (`<`)
-   greater than or equal (`>=`)
-   less than or equal (`<=`)

```
// Comparison operators1 > 3; // FALSE3 > 1; // TRUE250 >= 250; // TRUE1 === 1; // TRUE1 === 2; // FALSE1 === "1"; // FALSE
```

### PHP If Statements

PHP `if` statements evaluate a boolean value or expression and execute the provided code block if the expression evaluates to `TRUE`.

```
if (TRUE){  echo "TRUE is always true"; } $condition1 = TRUE;if ($condition1) {  // This code block will execute} $condition2 = FALSE;if ($condition2) {  // This code block will not execute}
```

### PHP switch statement

PHP `switch` statements provide a clear syntax for a series of comparisons in which a value or expression is compared to many possible matches and code blocks are executed based on the matching `case`.

In PHP, once a matched `case` is encountered, the code blocks of all subsequent cases (regardless of match) will be executed until a `return`, `break`, or the end of the statement is reached. This is known as _fall through_.

```
switch ($letter_grade){  case "A":    echo "Terrific";    break;  case "B":    echo "Good";    break;  case "C":    echo "Fair";    break;  case "D":    echo "Needs Improvement";    break;  case "F":    echo "See me!";    break;  default:    echo "Invalid grade";}
```

### PHP readline()

The PHP built-in `readline()` function takes a string with which to prompt the user. It waits for the user to enter text into the terminal and returns that value as a string.

```
echo "\nWhat's your name?\n";$name = readline(">> "); // receives user input
```

### PHP elseif statements

PHP `elseif` statements must be paired with an `if` statement, but many `elseif`s can be chained from a single `if`.

`elseif`s provide an additional condition to check (and corresponding code to execute) if the conditional statements of the `if` block and any preceding `elseif`s are not met.

```
$fav_fruit = "orange"; if ($fav_fruit === "banana"){  echo "Enjoy the banana!";} elseif ($fav_fruit === "apple"){  echo "Enjoy the apple!";} elseif ($fav_fruit === "orange"){  echo "Enjoy the orange!";} else {  echo "Enjoy the fruit!";}// Prints: Enjoy the orange!
```

### PHP Truthy and Falsy

PHP values within a condition will always be evaluated to `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Values that will evaluate to `TRUE` are known as _truthy_ and values that evaluate to `FALSE` are known as _falsy_.

_Falsy_ values include:

-   `false`
-   `0`
-   empty strings
-   `null`
-   `undefined`
-   `NaN`.

All other values are _truthy_.

```
if ("What's going on?"){   // evaluates to TRUE  echo "Let us explain…";} // Prints: Let us explain…
```

### PHP Boolean Values

PHP Boolean values are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`, which are the only members of the `boolean` type

```
// booleans$is_true = TRUE;$is_false = FALSE; echo gettype($is_true); // Prints: booleanecho gettype($is_false); // Prints: boolean
```

### PHP ternary operator

In PHP, the ternary operator allows for a compact syntax in the case of binary (`if/else`) decisions. It evaluates a single condition and executes one expression and returns its value if the condition is met and the second expression otherwise.

The syntax for the ternary operator looks like the following:

`condition ? expression1 : expression2`

```
// Without ternary$isClicked = FALSE;if ($isClicked) {  $link_color = "purple";} else {  $link_color = "blue";}// $link_color = "blue";  // With ternary$isClicked = FALSE;$link_color = $isClicked ? "purple" : "blue";//  $link_color = "blue";  
```

### PHP Nested Conditionals

In PHP, _nested conditional_ statements deepen the complexity of our programs’ decision-making capabilities. They allow us to create programs where each decision made sends our program on a different route where it might encounter additional decisions.

```
$num = 5;  // nested conditionalif ($num > 0){    echo 'The number is positive. <br>';      if ($num % 2 === 0){            echo 'The number is even.';      }} else {      echo 'The number is negative.';}
```

### PHP Logical Operators

In PHP, expressions that use logical operators evaluate to boolean values. Logical operators include:

-   or (`||`)
-   and (`&&`)
-   exclusive or (`xor`)
-   not (`!`)

```
// Examples of Logical Operators: TRUE || TRUE;   // Evaluates to: TRUEFALSE || TRUE;  // Evaluates to: TRUETRUE && TRUE;    // Evaluates to: TRUEFALSE && TRUE;   // Evaluates to: FALSE!TRUE;    // Evaluates to: FALSE!FALSE;   // Evaluates to: TRUETRUE xor TRUE;   // Evaluates to: FALSEFALSE xor TRUE;  // Evaluates to: TRUE
```

### PHP && Operator

The logical operator `&&` returns:

-   `TRUE` only if both of its operands evaluate to true.
-   `FALSE` if either or both of its operands evaluate to false.

```
TRUE && TRUE;    // Evaluates to: TRUEFALSE && TRUE;   // Evaluates to: FALSETRUE && FALSE;   // Evaluates to: FALSEFALSE && FALSE;  // Evaluates to: FALSE $passingGrades = TRUE;$extracurriculars = TRUE;if ($passingGrades && $extracurriculars){  echo "You meet the graduation requirements.";}// Prints: You meet the graduation requirements.
```

### PHP ! (not) Operator

In PHP, the not operator (`!`) is used to invert a Boolean value or expression.

```
!TRUE;    // Evaluates to: FALSE!FALSE;   // Evaluates to: TRUE
```

### PHP Operator Precedence

Each operator in PHP holds a different _operator precedence_.

We can avoid operator precedence confusion by using parentheses for force the evaluation we want.

```
TRUE || TRUE && FALSE // Evaluates to: TRUE(TRUE || TRUE) && FALSE // Evaluates to: FALSE 
```

### PHP Xor Operator

In PHP, the logical operator `xor` stands for exclusive or.

It takes two different boolean values or expressions as its operands and returns a single boolean value.

`xor` evaluates to `TRUE` **only** if either its left operand or its right operand evaluate to `TRUE`, but **not both**.

```
TRUE xor TRUE;   // Evaluates to: FALSEFALSE xor TRUE;  // Evaluates to: TRUETRUE xor FALSE;  // Evaluates to: TRUEFALSE xor FALSE; // Evaluates to: FALSE
```

### Logical Operators - Alternate Syntax

PHP provides an alternate syntax for the `||` operator — the `or` operator.

It also provides an alternate syntax for `&&` operator — the `and` operator.

These operators have the advantage of making our code more human readable.

```
// The or Operator:TRUE or TRUE;   // Evaluates to: TRUEFALSE or TRUE;  // Evaluates to: TRUETRUE or FALSE;  // Evaluates to: TRUEFALSE or FALSE; // Evaluates to: FALSE // The and Operator:TRUE and TRUE;   // Evaluates to: TRUEFALSE and TRUE;  // Evaluates to: FALSETRUE and FALSE;  // Evaluates to: FALSEFALSE and FALSE; // Evaluates to: FALSE
```

### Multi-File Programs: include

A way to improve our code and separate concerns is with _modularity_, separating a program into distinct, manageable chunks where each provides a piece of the overall functionality. Instead of having an entire program located in a single file, code is organized into separate files.

In PHP, files can be included in another file with the keyword `include`. An include statement is followed by a string with a path to the file to be included. The code from the file will be executed.

```
// one.phpecho "How are"; // two.phpecho " you?"; // index.phpecho "Hello! ";include "one.php";include "two.php";// Prints: Hello! How are you?
```
