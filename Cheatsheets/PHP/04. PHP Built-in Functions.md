### PHP built-in functions

PHP comes standard with many built-in functions. They give us an easier way to implement and repeat popular tasks throughout a program. A popular example is the `echo` function.

Many more are documented at [https://www.php.net/docs.php](https://www.php.net/docs.php). In addition to a description of what the function does, the documentation for each function denotes:

-   The name of the function
-   Required parameters and their types
-   Optional parameters (in square brackets, []), their types, and default values
-   The return type of the function (after the final colon, :)

```
echo "I am built in";
```
