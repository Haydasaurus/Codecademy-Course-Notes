### Java objects’ state and behavior
In Java, instances of a class are known as objects. Every object has state and behavior in the form of instance fields and methods respectively.

```Java
public class Person {
	// state of an object
	int age;
	String name;

	// behavior of an object
	public void set_value() {
		age = 20;
		name = "Robin";
	}
	public void get_value() {
		System.out.println("Age is " + age);
		System.out.println("Name is " + name);
	}

	// main method
	public static void main(String [] args) {
		// creates a new Person object
		Person p = new Person();

		// changes state through behavior
		p.set_value();
	}
}
```

### Java instance
Java instances are objects that are based on classes. For example, `Bob` may be an instance of the class `Person`.

Every instance has access to its own set of variables which are known as _instance fields_, which are variables declared within the scope of the instance. Values for instance fields are assigned within the constructor method.

```Java
public class Person {
	int age;
	String name;

	// Constructor method
	public Person(int age, String name) {
		this.age = age;
		this.name = name;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Person Bob = new Person(31, "Bob");
		Person Alice = new Person(27, "Alice");
	}
}
```

### Java dot notation
In Java programming language, we use `.` to access the variables and methods of an object or a Class.

This is known as _dot notation_ and the structure looks like this-

`instanceOrClassName.fieldOrMethodName`

```Java
public class Person {
	int age;

	public static void main(String [] args) {
		Person p = new Person();

		// here we use dot notation to set age
		p.age = 20;

		// here we use dot notation to access age and print
		System.out.println("Age is " + p.age);
		// Output: Age is 20
	}
}
```

### Constructor Method in Java
Java classes contain a _constructor_ method which is used to create instances of the class.

The constructor is named after the class. If no constructor is defined, a default empty constructor is used.

```Java
public class Maths {
	public Maths() {
		System.out.println("I am constructor");
	}
	public static void main(String [] args) {
		System.out.println("I am main");
		Maths obj1 = new Maths();
	}
}
```

---

### Creating a new Class instance in Java
In Java, we use the `new` keyword followed by a call to the class constructor in order to create a new _instance_ of a class.

The constructor can be used to provide initial values to instance fields.

```Java
public class Person {
	int age;
	// Constructor:
	public Person(int a) {
		age = a;
	}

	public static void main(String [] args) {
		// Here, we create a new instance of the Person class:
		Person p = new Person(20);
		System.out.println("Age is " + p.age); Prints: Age is 20
	}
}
```

---

### Reference Data Types
A variable with a reference data type has a value that references the memory address of an instance. During variable declaration, the class name is used as the variable’s type.

```Java
public class Cat {
	public Cat() {
		// instructions for creating a Cat instance
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// garfield is declared with reference data type `Cat`
		Cat garfield = new Cat();
		System.out.println(garfield); // Prints: Cat@76ed5528
	}
}
```

---

### Constructor Signatures
A class can contain multiple constructors as long as they have different parameter values. A signature helps the compiler differentiate between the different constructors.

A signature is made up of the constructor’s name and a list of its parameters.

```Java
// The signature is `Cat(String furLength, boolean hasClaws)`.
public class Cat {
	String furType;
	boolean containsClaws;

	public Cat(String furLength, boolean hasClaws) {
		furType = furLength;
		containsClaws = hasClaws;
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Cat garfield = new Cat("Long-hair", true);
	}
}
```

---

### null Values
`null` is a special value that denotes that an object has a void reference.

```Java
public class Bear {
  String species;
  public Bear(String speciesOfBear;) {
    species = speciesOfBear;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Bear baloo = new Bear("Sloth bear"); 
    System.out.println(baloo); // Prints: Bear@4517d9a3
    // set object to null
    baloo = null;
    System.out.println(baloo); // Prints: null
  }
}
```

### The body of a Java method
In Java, we use curly brackets `{}` to enclose the body of a method.

The statements written inside the `{}` are executed when a method is called.

```Java
public class Maths {
  public static void sum(int a, int b) { // Start of sum
    int result = a + b;
    System.out.println("Sum is " + result);
  } // End of sum
  
  
  public static void main(String [] args) {
    // Here, we call the sum method
    sum(10, 20);
    // Output: Sum is 30
  }
}
```

---

### Method parameters in Java
In java, parameters are declared in a method definition. The parameters act as variables inside the method and hold the value that was passed in. They can be used inside a method for printing or calculation purposes.

In the example, a and b are two parameters which, when the method is called, hold the value 10 and 20 respectively.

```Java
public class Maths {
  public int sum(int a, int b) {
    int k = a + b;
    return k;
  }
  
  public static void main(String [] args) {
    Maths m = new Maths();
    int result = m.sum(10, 20);
    System.out.println("sum is " + result);
    // prints - sum is 30
  }
}
```

---

### Java Variables Inside a Method
Java variables defined inside a method cannot be used outside the scope of that method.

```Java
//For example, `i` and `j` variables are available in the `main` method only:
 
public class Maths {
  public static void main(String [] args) {
    int i, j;
    System.out.println("These two variables are available in main method only");
  }
}
```

---

### Returning info from a Java method
A Java method can return any value that can be saved in a variable. The value returned must match with the return type specified in the method signature.

The value is returned using the `return` keyword.

```Java
public class Maths { 
  
  // return type is int
  public int sum(int a, int b) {
    int k;
    k = a + b;
    
    // sum is returned using the return keyword
    return k;
  }
  
  public static void main(String [] args) {
    Maths m = new Maths();
    int result;
    result = m.sum(10, 20);
    System.out.println("Sum is " + result);
    // Output: Sum is 30
  }
}
```

---

### Declaring a Method
Method declarations should define the following method information: scope (private or public), return type, method name, and any parameters it receives.

```Java
// Here is a public method named sum whose return type is int and has two int parameters a and b
public int sum(int a, int b) {
  return(a + b);
}
```
