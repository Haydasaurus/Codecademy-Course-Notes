### else Statement
The `else` statement executes a block of code when the condition inside the `if` statement is `false`. The `else` statement is always the last condition.

```Java
boolean condition1 = false;
 
if (condition1){
    System.out.println("condition1 is true");
}
else{
    System.out.println("condition1 is not true");
}
// Prints: condition1 is not true
```

### else if Statements
`else`-`if` statements can be chained together to check multiple conditions. Once a condition is `true`, a code block will be executed and the conditional statement will be exited.

There can be multiple `else`-`if` statements in a single conditional statement.

```Java
int testScore = 76;
char grade;
 
if (testScore >= 90) {
  grade = 'A';
} else if (testScore >= 80) {
  grade = 'B';
} else if (testScore >= 70) {
  grade = 'C';
} else if (testScore >= 60) {
  grade = 'D';
} else {
  grade = 'F';
}
 
System.out.println("Grade: " + grade); // Prints: C
```

---

### if Statement
An `if` statement executes a block of code when a specified boolean expression is evaluated as `true`.

```Java
if (true) {
    System.out.println("This code executes");
}
// Prints: This code executes
 
if (false) {
    System.out.println("This code does not execute");
}
// There is no output for the above statement
```

---

### Nested Conditional Statements
A nested conditional statement is a conditional statement nested inside of another conditional statement. The outer conditional statement is evaluated first; if the condition is `true`, then the nested conditional statement will be evaluated.

```Java
boolean studied = true;
boolean wellRested = true;
 
if (wellRested) {
  System.out.println("Best of luck today!");  
  if (studied) {
    System.out.println("You are prepared for your exam!");
  } else {
    System.out.println("Study before your exam!");
  }
}
 
// Prints: Best of luck today!
// Prints: You are prepared for your exam!
```

---

### AND Operator
The AND logical operator is represented by `&&`. This operator returns `true` if the `boolean` expressions on both sides of the operator are `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

```Java
System.out.println(true && true); // Prints: true
System.out.println(true && false); // Prints: false
System.out.println(false && true); // Prints: false
System.out.println(false && false); // Prints: false
```

---

### NOT Operator
The NOT logical operator is represented by `!`. This operator negates the value of a boolean expression.

```Java
boolean a = true;
System.out.println(!a); // Prints: false
 
System.out.println(!false) // Prints: true
```

---

### The OR Operator
The logical OR operator is represented by `||`. This operator will return `true` if at least one of the `boolean` expressions being compared has a `true` value; otherwise, it will return `false`.

```Java
System.out.println(true || true); // Prints: true
System.out.println(true || false); // Prints: true
System.out.println(false || true); // Prints: true
System.out.println(false || false); // Prints: false
```

---

### Conditional Operators - Order of Evaluation
If an expression contains multiple conditional operators, the order of evaluation is as follows: Expressions in parentheses -> NOT -> AND -> OR.

```Java
boolean foo = true && (!false || true); // true
/* 
(!false || true) is evaluated first because it is contained within parentheses. 
 
Then !false is evaluated as true because it uses the NOT operator. 
 
Next, (true || true) is evaluation as true. 
 
Finally, true && true is evaluated as true meaning foo is true. */
```
