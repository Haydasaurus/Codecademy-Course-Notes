### `cp` Copy

The shell command `cp` is used to copy files or directories.

The basic argument structure is `cp source destination`, where the `source` is the file/directory to copy to the `destination` file/directory.

```
$ cp file1 file1_copy
$ cp file1 file2 destination_folder
```

### Command Options

_Options_ can be used to modify the behavior of shell commands. Shell command _options_ are commonly represented by a single letter preceded by a `-`. For example, `-l`, `-a`, and `-d` could all be options that follow a shell command.

### `mv` Move

The shell command `mv` is used to move a file into a directory. Use `mv` with the source file as the first argument and the destination directory as the second argument.

```
$ mv index.html website/
```

### `rm` Remove

The shell command `rm` is used to delete files and directories. The `-r` flag deletes a directory and all of its files and directories (`rm -r`).

```
$ rm -r bad_selfies
```

### `ls` List Command Options

The shell command `ls` is used to list the contents in a directory. It can be combined with the following command options:

-   `-a`: lists all contents, including hidden files and directories.
-   `-l`: lists all contents, in long format.
-   `-t`: lists all contents, by the time they were last modified.

```
$ ls -a
$ ls -l
$ ls -t
```
