### Security Culture

Poor security culture can lead to poor security. Everyone in the company needs to know and respect important security practices.

Even large organizations can have “simple” vulnerabilities within their systems and security practices. For example, using the username `admin` and the password `password` for their admin account.

If breaches happen, organizations have a duty to respond promptly and ethically to those data breaches.
