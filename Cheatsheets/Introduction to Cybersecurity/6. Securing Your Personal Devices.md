### Securing Your Accounts

Attackers can use _credential stuffing_ to test username/password combinations. Attackers will use information from one hacked site to infiltrate accounts on other sites.

To protect yourself you should never:

-   Use weak passwords
-   Reuse passwords

Using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can make your accounts even more secure, even if your password is compromised.

### Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

_Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)_ keep you safe by providing both network security and anonymity.

They can protect against attacks like Man-in-the-Middle attacks because of their ability to encrypt web traffic.

### Software Updates

Keeping your knowledge and your software up to date will protect you against many cyberattacks.

Software updates often include updates that can protect against recently discovered threats.

### Hardening Your Device

_Hardening_ is the process of fortifying a system against attacks

Hardening a personal device should strike a balance between:

-   Security
-   Usability

You should base your decisions on the risks associated with the asset being hardened.

### Researching Hardening Techniques

Itâ€™s important to do research before implementing hardening techniques.

This is for two main reasons:

-   Different systems might require different techniques
-   Malicious actors might suggest fake security tips in order to gain access to your machine
