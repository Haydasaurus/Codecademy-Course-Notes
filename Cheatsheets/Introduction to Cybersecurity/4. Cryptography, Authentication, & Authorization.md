### Cryptography

_Cryptography_ is the process of encrypting and decrypting data in order to keep that data safe when storing or transmitting it.

_Encryption_ is a way of hiding data by converting it to an encoded format.

_Decryption_ is a way of revealing encrypted data by decoding it from its encoded format.

### Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data.

Asymmetric encryption uses a public key to encrypt data and a different private key to decrypt data.

### Hashing

Hashing is a one-way process that takes data of any size and represents it as a unique hash value of a fixed size. No matter how large or complex your file is, hashing provides a fast, reliable way to compare files and verify their authenticity.

Hashing can be used to store sensitive data in a secure way.

### Rainbow Tables

A _rainbow table_ is a massive table of common passwords and password-hash combinations used by attackers to break into accounts. One common technique we can take to protect ourselves from rainbow table attacks is the use of salts.

This means that an attacker who has stolen the hash won't find a match in their rainbow table and discover the user's password is "p@ssw0rd".](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/content/paths/web-security/bcrypt/Art 1131 -Rainbow Tables_Art1131_RainbowTables copy 3.svg)

### Salts

A _salt_ is a secret random string that is combined with a password prior to hashing specifically to defend against the use of rainbow tables.

_Rainbow tables_ are large lookup databases that consist of pre-computed password-hash combinations which correlate plaintext passwords with their hashes.

### Authentication & Authorization

_Authentication_ is who you are. Logging in with a username and password is an example of authentication.

_Authorization_ is what you can do. Only being allowed into non-VIP sections of the site is an example of authorization.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is more secure than single-factor authentication.

Using more forms of authentication makes an asset more secure.

One example of MFA would be:

-   First, logging into a website with a username and password
-   Then, receiving a One-Time Passcode (OTP) that needs to input into the same website

### OAuth

OAuth is a secure framework that makes use of a trusted third-party for authentication.

When a service asked if you want to “Sign in with ____”, this an example of OAuth.
